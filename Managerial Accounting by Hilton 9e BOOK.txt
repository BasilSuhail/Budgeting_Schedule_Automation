HOW DOES HILTON 9e MOVE BEYOND
MANUFACTURING TO EXPOSE STUDENTS
TO A RANGE OF BUSINESSES?
Managerial Accounting.
The world of business is changing dramatically. As a result, the role of managerial account-
ing is much different than it was years ago. Today, managerial accountants serve as inter-
nal business consultants, working side-by-side in cross-functional teams with managers
from all areas of the organization. For a thorough understanding of managerial accounting,
students should not only be able to produce accounting information, but also understand
how managers are likely to use and react to the information in a range of businesses.
The goal of Managerial Accounting is to acquaint students of business with the fundamen-
tal tools of management accounting and to promote their understanding of the dramatic
ways in which the fi eld is changing. The emphasis throughout the text is on using account-
ing information to help manage an organization.

WHAT’S NEW IN THE NINTH EDITION?
New Chapter Summaries
All of the chapter summaries have been completely rewritten, and they are now structured on the
learning objectives for each chapter. In the new chapter summaries, each of the chapter’s learning
objectives is repeated and its content appropriately summarized.
Pedagogy
Many chapters include revisions of pedagogy, condensing and streamlining of explanations and
addition of more current examples and references from the popular business press (e.g., The Wall
Street Journal and B loomberg Business Week ).
End-of-Chapter Assignment Material
The end-of-chapter assignment material has been very heavily revised. Virtually all of the quantitative
exercises, problems, and cases contain data different from that in the eighth edition.
Build a Spreadsheet
This popular feature has been completely revised for the ninth edition. Several exercises and problems
in each chapter include an optional requirement to build an Excel spreadsheet to solve the problem.
Service Industry Examples
As the service industry occupies an ever-greater role in the economy, even greater emphasis has been
placed on providing examples throughout the text of real-world service-industry firms using managerial
accounting information.
Contrast Companies
Contrast companies appear in every chapter and continue to provide major service-industry examples.
Management Accounting Practice
Several of these real-world examples have been revised and updated to make them more current, and
several new examples have been added.
Supplementary Chapters
Supplementary chapters on special topics are more accessible than ever. These supplements, located
on the Online Learning Center at w ww.mhhe.com/hilton9e, include:
• FIFO Method of Process Costing
• Process Costing in Sequential Production Departments: Weighted-Average Method
• Statement of Cash Flows
• Analyzing Financial Statements
The Solutions Manual for each supplement can be found on the password-protected Instructor’s side of
the Online Learning Center.

Preface

Your feedback is crucial in improving each new edition of M anagerial Accounting.
In response to your suggestions, you will find revised coverage of key topical areas,
new pedagogy for the most challenging topics, and new assignment material in the
ninth edition, as well as
CHAPTER-BY-CHAPTER CHANGES
The following list ranges from significant additions of new material to less major revisions and updates.
Chapter 1: A revised section on the major themes in managerial accounting adds significant discussion
of the management of capacity and capacity costs. This new material includes a discussion of
theoretical and practical capacity, and it provides an illustration of the cost of resources supplied, the
cost of resources used, and the cost of resources unused (i.e., the cost of unused capacity). Also new
in Chapter 1 is a revised discussion of the ethical climate of business and the role of the managerial
accountant.
Chapter 2: This chapter includes a revised discussion of the use of cost information in the financial
statements of Southwest Airlines, Walmart, and Caterpillar. Also revised is the discussion of mass
customization operations.
Chapter 3: The calculation of the predetermined overhead rate is revised to discuss the role of practical
capacity. Also revised are many end-of-chapter assignment items to account for the role of practical
capacity.
Chapter 5: The discussion of value-added costs is revised to distinguish between customer value-
added and business value-added costs. Also added is a discussion of practical capacity.
Chapter 6: A revised discussion of whether direct labor is a variable or a fixed cost appears in this
chapter. Also revised is the discussion of ethical issues surrounding the direct-labor cost classification.
Chapter 8: Added in this chapter is a discussion of practical capacity and its role in absorption costing.
Chapter 10: A revised discussion of labor standards in the service industry is added.
Chapter 12: Added to this chapter is an example of environmental costs based on the recent
catastrophic Gulf oil spill.
Chapter 13: A revised discussion of “pay for performance” is included in this chapter.
Chapter 14: A revised discussion of the steps in the decision-making process begins this chapter.
Appendix I: This appendix, which covers the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, has been updated. Included is
coverage of the Supreme Court case regarding the legitimacy of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

FOCUS COMPANY >>>
THIS CHAPTER’S FOCUS COMPANY is The Walt Disney Company. This
entertainment services company is a giant in the industry with theme
parks, feature film studios, animation
studios, television broadcasting, hotels
and resorts, and retail stores. Using The
Walt Disney Company as an illustration, we
will introduce the field of managerial account-
ing. We will explore how managerial accountants
work in partnership with managers to add value to
the organization. The major themes of managerial
accounting also are introduced, and we will return
to them throughout the book.
Each chapter is built around a focus company, in which the chapter’s key points
are illustrated. This chapter’s focus is on The Walt Disney Company. The focus
companies in subsequent chapters are not real companies, but they are realistic
scenarios built on actual company practices. Whenever the focus company is
discussed in the chapter, the company logo appears in the margin.

The Changing Role of
Managerial Accounting
in a Dynamic Business
Environment
IN CONTRAST >>>
In contrast to the entertainment services setting of The Walt Disney Company, we will
turn our attention to Gap, Inc. This major clothing retailer has over 3,100 stores around the
world, which sell Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Piperlime, and Athleta apparel. We will
explore Gap’s value chain, which is the set of linked, value-creating activities, ranging from
securing basic raw materials and energy to the ultimate delivery of products and services.
As a retailer, Gap focuses on apparel design, marketing, and sales. All manufacturing of its
clothing lines is contracted out to garment manufacturers throughout the world.
Each chapter also includes a contrast company. In most cases, the contrast company will present a key chapter
topic in an industry that is different from that of the focus company. In this chapter, the focus company (Walt
Disney) is an entertainment services company, whereas the contrast company (The Gap) is a fashion retailer.

objectives. An airline, such as Quantas or Southwest Airlines, might specify profit-
ability and customer service as its goals. The New York Police Department’s goals
would include public safety and security coupled with cost minimization. Second, in
pursuing an organization’s goals, managers need information. The information needs
of management range across financial, production, marketing, legal, and environmental
issues. Generally, the larger the organization is, the greater is management’s need for
information.

Chapter 1 The Changing Role of Managerial Accounting in a Dynamic Business Environment 5
Managerial Accounting: A Business Partnership with Management1
The role of managerial accounting is very different now than it was years ago. In the
past, managerial accountants operated in a strictly staff capacity, usually physically
separated from the managers for whom they provided reports and information. Now- “We are looked upon as

information they provide. The role of the accountant in leading-edge companies “has Caterpillar
been transformed from number cruncher and financial historian to being business part-
ner and trusted advisor.”2
An organization’s management team, on which managerial accountants play an inte-
gral role, seeks to create value for the organization by managing resources, activities, and
people to achieve the organization’s goals effectively.
Managing Resources, Activities, and People
The owners, directors, or trustees of an organization set its goals, often with the help of
management. For example, The Walt Disney Company’s goals are set by its board of
directors, who are elected by the company’s stockholders. The overall goal of The Walt
Disney Company, according to a recent annual report, may be expressed as a commit-
ment to creative excellence and guest service coupled with strict financial discipline in
order to maximize value to the company’s shareholders.3
In pursuing its goals, an organization acquires resources, hires people, and then
engages in an organized set of activities. It is up to the management team to make the best
use of the organization’s resources, activities, and people in achieving the organization’s

goals. The day-to-day work of the management team comprises four activities:

organizations attain their goals.
Decision Making
Several years ago, Disney’s board of directors decided as one of the company’s growth
objectives to expand its theme park operations in Florida. It was not immediately clear,
however, what would be the best way to accomplish that goal. Would it be best to expand
one of the company’s three existing theme parks—the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, or Disney-
MGM Studios? Or should the company branch out in an entirely new direction with a

3 The Walt Disney Company, which is discussed in this chapter, is, of course, a real company. However, the subse-
quent focus organizations around which chapters are built are not real organizations. They are, however, realistic
settings in which to discuss business and managerial accounting issues. In most cases, they are based on real orga-
nizations. Similarly, each chapter includes a discussion of a contrast company. Some of these contrast companies,
such as clothing retailer Gap, Inc. in this chapter, are real companies. Others, however, are fictitious companies that
are based on real organizations. These realistic illustrations and scenarios are intended to help students connect the
business and managerial accounting issues discussed in this book to everyday life.

in the intended manner and achieves its goals.
How Managerial Accounting Adds Value to the Organization
Managers need information for all of the managerial activities described in the preced-
ing section. That information comes from a variety of sources, including economists,
financial experts, marketing and production personnel, and the organization’s managerial
accounting system.
Objectives of Managerial Accounting Activity
Managerial accountants add value to an organization by pursuing five major objectives:

managing the organization’s activities. As we will see in subsequent chapters, contem- (1c)
porary managerial accounting systems are focusing more and more on the activities that Hewlett-Packard
occur on all levels of the organization. Measuring, managing, and continually improving
operational activities are critical to an organization’s success.
To illustrate the objectives of managerial accounting activity, let us continue with the
example of Disney’s Animal Kingdom.
Providing Information for Decision Making and Planning, and
Proactively Participating as Part of the Management Team in the
Decision-Making and Planning Processes For virtually all major decisions,
Disney’s management team would rely largely on managerial accounting information.
For example, the decision to establish the new theme park would be influenced heavily
by estimates of the costs of building the Animal Kingdom and maintaining it throughout
its life. The theme park’s managers also would rely on managerial accounting data in
formulating plans for the park’s operations. Prominent in those plans would be a budget
detailing the projected revenues and costs of providing entertainment.
While Disney’s top management contemplated its decision about the theme park, the
company’s managerial accountants could not simply gather information and then sit on
the sidelines. The managerial accountants were key participants in the management team “What we’re seeing is less

the theme park’s various food venues. In controlling operations, management would
compare actual costs incurred with those specified in the budget.
Managerial accounting information often assists management through its attention-
directing function. Managerial accounting reports rarely solve a decision problem.
However, managerial accounting information often directs managers’ attention to
an issue that requires their skills. To illustrate, suppose Disney’s Animal Kingdom
incurred electricity costs that significantly exceeded the budget. This fact does not
explain why the budget was exceeded, nor does it tell management what action to
take, but it does direct management’s attention to the situation. Suppose that upon
further investigation, the accounting records reveal that the local electric rates have
increased substantially. This information will help management in framing the deci-
sion problem. Should steps be taken to conserve electricity? Should the park’s hours
be curtailed? Perhaps management should consider switching to a lower-cost method
of air conditioning.

8 Chapter 1 The Changing Role of Managerial Accounting in a Dynamic Business Environment
Motivating Managers and Other Employees Toward the Organi-
zation’s Goals Organizations have goals. However, organizations comprise people
who have goals of their own. The goals of individuals are diverse, and they do not always
match those of the organization. A key purpose of managerial accounting is to motivate
managers and other employees to direct their efforts toward achieving the organization’s
goals. One means of achieving this purpose is through budgeting. In establishing a budget
for Disney’s Animal Kingdom, top management indicates how resources are to be allo-
cated and what activities are to be emphasized. When actual operations do not conform
to the budget, the theme park’s managers will be asked to explain the reasons for the
deviation.
One way in which employees can be motivated toward the organization’s goals is
through empowerment. Employee empowerment is the concept of encouraging and
authorizing workers to take the initiative to improve operations, reduce costs, and improve
product quality and customer service. At The Walt Disney Company’s theme parks, for
example, employees are routinely asked for suggestions about ways to improve service to
the parks’ millions of visitors.
Measuring the Performance of Activities, Subunits, Managers,
and Other Employees Within the Organization One means of motivat-
ing people toward the organization’s goals is to measure their performance in achieving
those goals. Such measurements then can be used as the basis for rewarding performance
through positive feedback, promotions, and pay raises. For example, most large corpo-
rations compensate their executives, in part, on the basis of the profit achieved by the
subunits they manage. In other companies, executives are rewarded on the basis of opera-
tional measures, such as product quality, sales, or on-time delivery. At Disney’s Animal
Kingdom, for example, management could be rewarded, in part, on the basis of growth in
attendance at the theme park.
In addition to measuring the performance of people, the managerial accounting sys-
tem measures the performance of an organization’s subunits, such as divisions, product
lines, geographical territories, and departments. These measurements help the subunits’
managers obtain the highest possible performance level in their units. Such measure-
ments also help top management decide whether a particular subunit is a viable eco-
nomic investment. For example, it may turn out that a particular attraction at Disney’s
Animal Kingdom is too costly an activity to continue, despite the efforts of a skilled
management team.

Qwest Among the questions asked in assessing an organization’s competitive position are the
following:
• How well is the organization doing in its internal operations and business
processes?
• How well is the organization doing in the eyes of its customers? Are their needs
being served as well as possible?
• How well is the organization doing from the standpoint of innovation, learning,
and continuously improving operations? Is the organization a trendsetter that

The Balanced Scorecard
The questions listed in the preceding section are so important for any organization’s man-
agement to address that they have been organized into a management framework called
the balanced scorecard, which is depicted in Exhibit 1–1 for The Walt Disney Company.4
The balanced scorecard is a model of business performance evaluation that balances
measures of financial performance, internal operations, innovation and learning, and cus-
tomer satisfaction.
If an organization is to remain viable in a changing and ever more competitive busi-
ness environment, its managers need to continually ask the questions emphasized in the
balanced scorecard. The Walt Disney Company is no exception. Disney’s management
team must be concerned with the cost effectiveness of the company’s business processes
as well as its entertainment services. Management must continually monitor the needs
of its customers and assess their level of satisfaction with the services provided. The
company’s overall financial strength also must be prominent in management’s thinking.
4 The balanced scorecard concept was developed by Robert S. Kaplan and David D. Norton. See Robert S. Kaplan
and David D. Norton, T he Strategy-Focused Organization: How Balanced Scorecard Companies Thrive in the New
Business Environment (Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 2001).

We will hold off on an extensive discussion of the balanced scorecard until Chapter 10.
However, let’s briefly consider the goals and measures that Disney’s top management
might consider for the balanced scorecard depicted in Exhibit 1–1. According to the com-
pany’s Web site, The Walt Disney Company’s “primary financial goals are to maximize
earnings and cash flow, and to allocate capital profitably toward growth initiatives that

will drive long-term shareholder value.” So Disney’s financial perspective would include
such measures as earnings, earnings per share, and cash flow.
Now the question is, for Disney to achieve its financial goals in the future, what does
the company need to be doing now in the balanced scorecard’s other three perspectives?
For its customer perspective, Disney might use surveys to access customer satisfaction
with its theme parks, movies, and products, as well as collect more objective data such
as the number of visitors per day at its theme parks, attendance at its feature films, and
customer traffic through the many Disney stores. For the learning and growth perspec-
tive, Disney could focus on new theme parks opened, new theme park attractions, new
feature film releases, and new media outlets. For its internal operations perspective,
Disney could focus on measures such as operating expense per theme park attendee,
meals served per attendee, number of visitors at each attraction, rate of employee reten-
tion, and so forth. The key point of the balanced scorecard concept is that by focusing
on measures of performance now in these three key perspectives, Disney can achieve its
financial goals in the future.
Many companies, in all types of industries, have developed a balanced scorecard
to help management and employees achieve success on the company’s key long-term
goals. Among the many service-industry firms that have developed a balanced scorecard
are Bank of America, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Citicorp, JPMorganChase, Fannie Mae,
Mayo Clinic, National City Bank (now part of PNC), Nationwide Mutual Insurance, and
Wells Fargo Online Financial Services. Retailers, too, have made use of the balanced
scorecard. Among them are The Gap and IKEA.
Among the well-known manufacturers making use of the balanced-scorecard con-
cept are Apple Computer, Caterpillar, Caltex Petroleum, Cisco Systems, Chrysler, Eli
Lilly, ExxonMobil, General Motors, Microsoft, Motorola, and Phillips Electronics.
Finally, governmental units have benefited from a balanced scorecard, among them
the City of Brisbane, Australia, NASA, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the U.S.
Department of Transportation.
We will come back to the balanced scorecard in Chapter 10.
Managerial versus Financial Accounting
Take another look at the major objectives of managerial accounting activity. Notice that
Learning Objective 4
the focus in each of these objectives is on managers. Thus, the focus of managerial

outside the organization. The annual report distributed by McDonald’s Corporation or
Mutual of Omaha to its stockholders is an example of the output from a financial account-
ing system. Users of financial accounting information include current and prospective
stockholders, lenders, investment analysts, unions, consumer groups, and government
agencies.
There are many similarities between managerial accounting information and finan-
cial accounting information because they both draw upon data from an organization’s
basic accounting system. This is the system of procedures, personnel, and computers
used to accumulate and store financial data in the organization. One part of the overall
accounting system is the cost accounting system, which accumulates cost data for use
in both managerial and financial accounting. For example, production cost data typically
are used in helping managers set prices, which is a managerial accounting use. However,
production cost data also are used to value inventory on a manufacturer’s balance sheet,
which is a financial accounting use.
Exhibit 1–2 depicts the relationships among an organization’s basic accounting sys-
tem, cost accounting system, managerial accounting, and financial accounting. Although
similarities do exist between managerial and financial accounting, the differences are
even greater. Exhibit 1–3 lists the most important differences.

and participates as an integral member of the management team. Most controllers are
involved in planning and decision making at all levels and across all functional areas of
the enterprise. This broad role has enabled many managerial accountants to rise to the
top of their organizations. Former accountants have served as top executives in such
companies as General Motors, Singer, General Electric, and Fruehauf.
In addition to the CFO or controller for the entire corporation, most companies,
including The Walt Disney Company, have divisional controllers. Thus, Disney’s detailed
organization chart would show a controller for ABC, Inc., Disneyland Paris, Walt Disney
Studios, and so forth.
Treasurer The treasurer typically is responsible for raising capital and safeguard-
ing the organization’s assets. In addition, the treasurer is responsible for the organi-
zation’s assets, the management of its investments, its credit policy, and its insurance
coverage.
Internal Auditor Most large corporations and many governmental agencies have
an internal auditor. An organization’s internal auditor is responsible for reviewing the
accounting procedures, records, and reports in both the controller’s and the treasur-
er’s areas of responsibility. The auditor then expresses an opinion to top management
regarding the effectiveness of the organization’s accounting system. In some organiza-
tions, the internal auditor’s role is much more extensive than this and can include a
broad performance evaluation of middle and lower management.
Cross-Functional Deployment
On a formal organization chart, accountants generally are in a staff capacity, as
explained in the preceding section. However, managerial accountants are increas-
ingly being deployed in cross-functional management teams. Managerial accountants
work with executives from top management, marketing and sales personnel, design
engineers, operations managers, legal experts, quality-control personnel, and virtually
every other specialized type of employee in an organization. Managerial teams are
formed to make decisions, engage in planning exercises, or address operational prob-
lems from many perspectives. Since financial and other managerial accounting issues
often are critically important in addressing business problems, managerial accountants
routinely play a major role in these cross-functional teams. Panel B of Exhibit 1–4
depicts several plausible cross-functional teams formed to address a variety of hypo-
thetical business problems at The Walt Disney Company. Notice that each of these
teams pulls together individuals from a variety of specialties, such as marketing, opera-
tions, general management, customer relations, and the general counsel’s office (legal
issues). Given Disney’s overall business strategy, creative talent is almost always pres-

Finally, where do managerial accountants actually do their work? The answer is “just
toward that and less and less
about everywhere.” As Panel C of Exhibit 1–4 highlights, managerial accountants are

in every part of an enterprise, from corporate headquarters to the locations where goods

and services are being produced. At Disney, for example, managerial accountants
would be present on location when a feature film is being produced, near the ABC news
room when decisions are made about deploying journalistic resources, and in the vari-
ous Disney hotels, such as the Disney Ambassador Hotel in Tokyo.

Chapter 1 The Changing Role of Managerial Accounting in a Dynamic Business Environment 17
Major Themes in Managerial Accounting
Several major themes influence virtually all aspects of managerial accounting. We will

briefly introduce these themes now, and they will be apparent throughout the text.
Briefly describe some of the
major contemporary themes in

managerial accounting.
The need for information is the driving force behind managerial accounting. However,
managerial accounting information often serves two functions: a decision-facilitating
function and a decision-influencing function. Information usually is supplied to a deci-
sion maker to assist that manager in choosing an alternative. Often, that information is
also intended to influence the manager’s decision.
To illustrate, let us consider The Walt Disney Company’s annual budget. Although
the budget is prepared under the direction of the CFO, it must be approved by the
Managerial accounting information is vital in all types of organizations. Managerial accountants act as
strategic business partners in support of management’s roles in decision making and directing operational
activities. Pictured here are a manufacturer, a service-industry firm, a retailer, and a nonprofit city
firefighting service. How would managerial accounting be important in each of these organizations?

chairman of the board and CEO and, ultimately, by the board of directors. As part of
the budget approval process, the CEO and the board of directors will make important
decisions that determine how the company’s resources will be allocated. Throughout
the year, the decisions of management will be facilitated by the information contained
in the budget. Management decisions also will be influenced by the budget, since at
year-end actual expenditures will be compared with the budgeted amounts. Explana-
tions will then be requested for any significant deviations.
Behavioral Issues
The reactions of both individuals and groups to managerial accounting information will
significantly affect the course of events in an organization. How will the general manager
of Disney’s Animal Kingdom react to a budget? How will data regarding the cost of pro-
viding entertainment services affect the way the theme park’s management prices those
services? How much detail should be included in the quarterly accounting reports to the
general manager? If too much detail is provided, will the manager be overloaded with
information and distracted from the main points?
All of these questions involve the behavioral tendencies of people and their cog-
nitive limitations in using information. The better a managerial accountant’s under-
standing of human behavior is, the more effective he or she will be as a provider of
information.
Costs and Benefits
Information is a commodity, much like wheat or corn. Like other goods, information can
be produced, purchased, and consumed. It can be of high or low quality, timely or late,
appropriate for its intended use or utterly irrelevant. As is true of all goods and services,
information entails both costs and benefits. The costs of providing managerial accounting
information to the managers in Disney’s Animal Kingdom include the cost of compen-
sation for the theme park’s controller and Accounting Department personnel, the cost
of purchasing and operating computers, and the cost of the time spent by the informa-
tion users to read, understand, and utilize the information. The benefits include improved
decisions, more effective planning, greater efficiency of operations at lower costs, and
better direction and control of operations.
Thus, there are both costs and benefits associated with managerial accounting infor-
mation. The desirability of any particular managerial accounting technique or information
must be determined in light of its costs and benefits. We will reinforce this cost-benefit
trade-off throughout the text by pointing out areas where managerial accounting informa-
tion could be improved, but only at too great a cost.
Management of Capacity and Capacity Costs
A key objective of managerial accounting information is the management of an organiza-
tion’s capacity and the costs of providing that capacity. By capacity we mean the upper
limit on the amount of goods or services that an organization can produce in a specified
period of time. For example, how many iPads can Apple manufacture in a month? Or
how many people can Disney’s Magic Kingdom effectively accommodate in a day?
Or how many cell phone calls or text messages can your cell phone company process in
an hour?
There are various concepts of an organization’s capacity. Theoretical capacity refers
to the upper limit on production of goods or services if everything works perfectly. (This
means that no employees miss time for illness, no machines break down, there are no
unexpected interruptions such as power outages or severe storms, and so forth.) Most
management accountants believe that a more useful concept of capacity is practical
hiL10912_ch01_002-035.indd 18 6/25/10 6:00 PM
================================================================================
PAGE 54
================================================================================

Chapter 1 The Changing Role of Managerial Accounting in a Dynamic Business Environment 19
capacity, which allows for normal occurrences such as machine downtime and employee
fatigue or illness.
Important questions for the managerial accounting system to address are: (1) What is
an organization’s practical capacity? (2) What are the costs of the resources supplied to
provide that capacity? and (3) How have those resources been used?
To explore these issues, let’s focus on a familiar scenario, the pizza business. Sup-
pose you have taken a job at the nearby college pizza shop making pizzas. (You know,
the one just down the street where you go with your friends after an exam to celebrate,
or before studying for the exam to fortify yourself, or when you should be studying for
the exam, because, well, eating pizza is more fun than studying.) You work the 8:00
to 10:00 PM shift three evenings a week, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. In addition
to the obvious fringe benefit of getting to scarf the occasional slice of pizza with your
favorite toppings, you receive a wage of $8 an hour. So each evening that you work, you
make $16.
After some training and a little experience, you can make a pizza, on aver-
age, in about five minutes. This includes picking up a premeasured lump of pizza
dough, patting it out, twirling it ostentatiously over your head a few times, putting it
down, covering it with pizza sauce, applying the cheese and other toppings, and toss-
ing it in the oven. (The difference in time to apply the toppings on a plain cheese pizza
or one with “the works” is negligible.) Also, the five-minute average time required
per pizza allows for occasional mistakes, fatigue, cell-phone calls, and other nor-
mal events. You have one 20-minute break during your two-hour shift, so on a busy
evening, you could make as many as 20 pies (100 minutes available ! the average
5 minutes per pizza).
So, using the terminology discussed above, the cost of the labor resources supplied
for your two-hour shift is $16, and the practical capacity of that two-hour shift is 20
pizzas made.
Now suppose that during the first week of October, you experience very different
levels of demand on your three evening shifts. Monday night football causes a steady
demand for pizzas, and you make 20 pies that evening. Wednesday evening is pretty slow,
and you make just 10 pies. Friday evening, which is normally very busy, is unusually
slow because of a pep rally held that evening before the next day’s big game against your
school’s arch rival, the Fighting Piglets. You make just one pie.
Now we must calculate the cost of your labor for a pizza during each of your three
shifts. One fairly simple answer is to divide your labor cost per shift by the number of
pizzas you made in each shift, as follows:
Shift Labor Cost Pizzas Made Cost per Pizza
Monday $16.00 20 $ .80
Wednesday 16.00 10 1.60
Friday 16.00 1 16.00
Let’s stop and think about this. Does this analysis make any sense? Most accountants
and managers would argue that it does not make much sense to say that Monday’s pizzas
cost $.80 each for your labor, Wednesday’s cost $1.60 each, and the one you made Friday
cost $16.00! This result highlights the problem of confusing the cost of a resource sup-
plied with the cost of a resource used. The cost of your labor resource supplied during
each shift was $16.00, but the cost of your labor resource used varied from shift to shift
due to widely different demand levels.
Many cost managers would argue that the cost of your labor resource used should be
computed as shown in column (c) of the following table. Moreover, the cost of your labor
resource used per pizza is a constant $.80 per pizza, regardless of demand, as calculated
in column (d). Finally, the cost of your labor resource unused (i.e., the cost of unused
capacity) is calculated in column (e).

The moral of the story is that it is very important to distinguish between the cost of
resources supplied [column (b) above], the cost of resources used [column (c) above],
and the cost of resources unused [column (e) above], which is the same as the cost of
unused capacity. An important task for any management team is to understand and man-
age the cost of capacity.8
Evolution and Adaptation in Managerial Accounting

major contemporary themes in changing rapidly. For managerial accounting to be as useful a tool in the future as it has
managerial accounting. been in the recent past, managerial accounting information must be adapted to reflect
those changes. Several changes in the business environment that are especially pertinent
to managerial accounting are discussed briefly here. The effect of these changes on vari-
ous topics in managerial accounting will be explored in subsequent chapters.
E-Business E-commerce, e-business, e-tailing! Our ever-expanding e-vocabulary
is testimony to the rapid electronic transformation of the business environment. Most
of us have gone online to order a book from Amazon.com, an airline reservation from
expedia.com, or possibly a computer from dell.com. We are all aware of the many dot-
com companies that populate the electronic-retailing landscape. We’re also aware that
these companies appear and often disappear at an alarming pace. Nevertheless, the elec-
tronic revolution in the marketplace is here to stay.
Perhaps what we’re less aware of, though, is the depth of the e-commerce impact
throughout the spectrum of the business environment. Just as we can order books, CDs,
or clothing online in consumer-to-business e-commerce channels, businesses can order
raw materials and supplies using business-to-business networks. Supply-chain man-
agement, which encompasses the coordination of order generation, order taking, order
fulfillment, and distribution of products and services, is increasingly an electronic,
online process. E-commerce may be defined as buying and selling over digital media.9
E-business is a broader concept. In addition to encompassing e-commerce, e-business
includes the business processes that form the engine for modern business.
8 This is, of course, a very simple illustration, because it focuses on a single resource, i.e., the cost of one employee’s
labor. Even a business as simple as a pizza shop involves many resources, such as pizza ingredients, multiple
employees, buildings and equipment, and advertising. Imagine how much more complicated capacity issues are for a
major airline or a large manufacturer. Nevertheless, by exploring the concepts of capacity and the cost of capacity in
a very simple scenario, you should have an initial understanding of this critical issue. For a current article about man-
aging capacity, see D. Welch and I. Rowley, “Risky Business at Nissan,” BusinessWeek, November 2, 2009, p. 34.

Chapter 1 The Changing Role of Managerial Accounting in a Dynamic Business Environment 21
Managerial accountants are rapidly moving toward e-accounting themselves by
harnessing the power of online communications to streamline the procedures of mana-
gerial accounting. For example, e-budgeting is now used by hundreds of companies to
quickly and effectively transmit the information needed to construct a budget from far-
flung business units around the globe.
E-business is here to stay, and it will affect our lives and our jobs in ways we can’t
even imagine today.
Service versus Manufacturing Firms The service sector occupies a growing
role in the U.S. economy. Moreover, several key service industries have been deregulated
by the government. The telecommunications, financial services, and airline industries are
among them. As more and more companies provide financial, medical, communication,
transportation, consulting, and hospitality services, managerial accounting techniques
must be adapted to meet the needs of managers in those industries. The key difference
between service and manufacturing firms is that most services are consumed as they are
produced. Most services cannot be inventoried like manufactured goods. Service organi-
zations also tend to be more labor-intensive than manufacturing firms. Many of the tech-
niques developed for measuring costs and performance in manufacturing companies have
been adapted successfully to service industry firms. Throughout the text, you will notice
that roughly two-thirds of the illustrations of managerial accounting techniques involve
service industry firms and nonprofit organizations.
Global Competition “It’s a small world!” Although this cliché has been around
a long time, it concisely sums up today’s business environment. Nowadays the market-
place is truly a global one. A firm is just as likely to be in competition with a company
from Japan, Germany, or Korea as from across town. Intense international competition is
forcing companies to strive for excellence in product quality and service more than ever
before.
Moreover, international economic arrangements and potential trade agreements are
constantly in the news, as national economies become more and more intertwined. Orga-
nizations such as the European Union (EU) and the World Trade Organization (WTO),
as well as international agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA), all have the potential to dramatically change international commerce.
A multinational company is an organization that has operational subunits, such as
manufacturing plants or sales facilities, in two or more countries. Multinational firms face
several challenges that do not confront domestic companies. Political systems, account-
ing rules for external reporting, legal systems, and cultural norms vary widely among
countries. Managers of multinationals must be aware of these differences to successfully
carry out operations across international boundaries. Income tax systems differ among
countries also. In planning international operations, managers of multinationals must
take into account the different tax laws and rates in the countries where they do business.
Monetary systems also differ among countries, and multinationals must continually
monitor the fluctuating values of foreign currencies. The price at which one country’s
currency can be converted into that of another country is called an exchange rate. For
example, on the day this paragraph is being written, it takes $.9199 in U.S. dollars
to buy one Australian dollar. The exchange rate can fluctuate daily as various forces
shape the world economy. As a result of these fluctuating exchange rates, managers of
multinationals face challenges as they sign contracts, buy and sell goods, and conduct
business operations in many countries.
Cross-Functional Teams In years past, managers tended to stick to their own
turf. Production managers focused on how best to manufacture a product or produce
a service. Marketing managers concentrated on selling the product or service. Design
engineers often emphasized engineering elegance rather than designing a product for

streams, trimming inventories, and serving customers and employees more efficiently.”
Harrah’s Casino,
Here are some examples of how companies are using the Web to their advantage.
Continental Airlines,
and MoMA
Walmart
Walmart has recently made a major foray into the realm of online sales. “Customers who
buy some of the more than 1.5 million products on Walmart.com can have them shipped
free to a local Walmart, where new service desks at the front of some stores make it eas-
ier for customers to retrieve their stuff.” Walmart is even experimenting with drive-through
windows for merchandise pickup. The payoff: Walmart is now one of the top e-commerce
sites in terms of traffic.
Harrah’s Casino
“For years, casino operator Harrah’s has had a database of customers it woos with cheap
hotel rooms. Harrah’s linked the database to its Web site, allowing customers to go online
and book rooms at discount prices based on their past spending habits.” The payoff:
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, occupancy at Harrah’s flagship Las
Vegas hotel fell by 25 percent. “The chain sent e-mails with bargain offers, filling 4,000
rooms that otherwise would have stayed empty and bringing the hotel back to near-100
percent occupancy by September 30.”10
Continental Airlines
The airline adopted a project to “analyze data on the fly to improve customer care.
One online system alerts the company when planes arrive late and assesses passen-
ger needs—delaying departures on other flights or sending carts to make connections
easier. The payoff: After ranking last in the industry for customer satisfaction, Continental
climbed into the top tier—ahead of American, United, and USAirways.”
Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)
This New York City art museum undertook a $425 million rebuilding project, and “the
museum’s management pumped up the use of technology to cater better to visitors.
The payoff: New services include podcast audio tours, on demand printing of tickets,”
Internet-based viewing of programming and displays, and an online store.11
manufacturability. Managerial accountants provided information for decision making,
planning, control, and performance evaluation.1011
Today a cross-functional approach has replaced this narrow managerial perspective.
Cross-functional managerial teams bring together production and operations managers,
marketing managers, purchasing and material-handling specialists, design engineers,
quality management personnel, and managerial accountants to focus their varied exper-
tise and experience on virtually all management issues. If products are to be designed and
manufactured with the customers’ needs in mind, a cross-functional approach is crucial.
Marketing managers have the best feel for customer needs, and production managers are

up on the latest in manufacturing technology. Design engineers know how to build the
functionality into a product that customers demand, and purchasing managers can acquire
the materials, parts, and services necessary to get the job done. Managerial accounting
information is the glue that holds the cross-functional team together. The managerial
accountant designs an information system and provides data ranging across all aspects
of the organization’s internal operations and external environment. Then the managerial
accountant works as an integral member of the cross-functional team, interpreting infor-
mation and analyzing the implications of decision alternatives. Working together, the
cross-functional team creates value for the organization by meeting the customer’s needs
in the most effective manner possible.
Product Life Cycles and Diversity One impact of highly automated manufac-
turing systems has been to enable manufacturers to produce an ever-more diverse set of
products. Moreover, the rate at which technology is changing means that the life cycles of
most products are becoming shorter. In the computer industry, for example, product mod-
els are used only a few years before they are replaced by more powerful versions. To be
competitive, manufacturers must keep up with the rapidly changing marketplace. Manag-
ers must have timely information about production costs and other product characteristics
in order to respond quickly and effectively to the competition.
Information and Communication Technology We are all confronted with
the breakneck pace of technological change. Just as we learn how to get the most out of
our personal computers or to set up our cell phones, they are replaced by new and better
models. It would be hard to overestimate the impact of technological innovation on the
business environment. Although large mainframe computers still perform certain kinds
of tasks, businesses now make heavy use of personal computers. In most offices, virtually
every employee has a personal computer for such tasks as word processing, data analy-
sis, report generation, presentation preparation, and communication. These PCs are usu-
ally linked together in a network that enables employees to electronically transfer files
and reports, share data, and communicate via e-mail. Often called an intranet, these net-
worked PCs are invaluable tools in the era of crossfunctional management teams. More-
over, these intranets are not confined to the walls of a building, as the World Wide Web or
Internet allows computer-to-computer interface anywhere in the world.
Managerial accounting analyses that in years past would have to be scheduled on a
mainframe computer are now done on PCs using a variety of software products. Spread- “The pace of change in

Managerial accountants often play significant roles in selecting software for their organi-
zations or designing in-house software to meet the organization’s unique needs.
Just-in-Time Inventory Management In traditional manufacturing set-
tings, inventories of raw materials and parts, partially completed components, and fin-
ished goods were kept as a buffer against the possibility of running out of a needed item.
However, large buffer inventories consume valuable resources and generate hidden costs.
Consequently, many companies have completely changed their approach to production
and inventory management. These manufacturers have adopted a strategy for controlling
the flow of manufacturing in a multistage production process. In a just-in-time (JIT)
production system, raw materials and parts are purchased or produced just in time to be

To visualize this approach, look at Exhibit 1–5, which displays a simple diagram of a
multistage production process. The flow of manufacturing activity is depicted by the

the signal that triggers more production activity in each stage comes from the next stage

more production of finished goods, the goods are “pulled” from production stage III by
sending a signal that more goods are needed. Similarly, when production employees in
stage III need more inputs, they send a signal back to stage II. This triggers production
activity in stage II. Working our way back to the beginning of the process, purchases
of raw materials and parts are triggered by a signal that they are needed in stage I. This
pull system of production management, which characterizes the JIT approach, results
in a smooth flow of production and significantly reduced inventory levels. The result is
considerable cost savings for the manufacturer.
Total Quality Management One implication of a just-in-time inventory philoso-
phy is the need to emphasize product quality. If a component is to be produced just in time
for the next production stage, it must be “just right” for its intended purpose. One flawed
component can shut down the entire production line, entailing considerable cost. Therefore,
managerial accountants have become involved increasingly in monitoring product quality
and measuring the costs of maintaining quality. This information helps companies maintain
programs of total quality management, or TQM. This refers to the broad set of manage-
ment and control processes designed to focus the entire organization and all of its employees
on providing products or services that do the best possible job of satisfying the customer.
Continuous Improvement Global competition is forcing companies to continu-
ously improve their operations. Continuous improvement is the constant effort to elimi-
nate waste, reduce response time, simplify the design of both products and processes, and
improve quality and customer service. One compelling reason for the need for continuous
improvement is the price down/cost down concept. This refers to the tendency of prices
to fall over the life cycle of a newly introduced product. Think, for example, about the
prices of laptop computers, personal listening devices, and high-definition televisions.
When each of these products was first introduced, prices were quite high. However, as
manufacturers gained experience in producing them, prices fell and the products became
accessible to a much wider customer pool. However, if prices are to fall over time, manu-
facturers must continually reduce costs as well.

Chapter 1 The Changing Role of Managerial Accounting in a Dynamic Business Environment 25
One widely used approach to cost reduction is kaizen costing, which is the process
of cost reduction during the manufacturing phase of an existing product. The Japanese
word kaizen refers to continual and gradual improvement through small betterment activ-
ities rather than large or radical improvement made through innovation or large invest-
ments in technology. The idea is simple. Improvement is the goal and responsibility of
every worker, from the CEO to the manual laborers, in every activity, every day, all the
time! Through the small but continual efforts of everyone, significant reductions in costs
can be attained over time.
Cost Management Systems
The explosion in technology we are experiencing, coupled with increasing worldwide
competition, is forcing managers to produce high-quality goods and services, provide
outstanding customer service, and do so at the lowest possible cost. These demands are
placing ever-greater requirements on the information provided by managerial accounting
systems. Many companies have moved away from a historical cost accounting perspec-
tive and toward a proactive cost management perspective. A cost management system is
a management planning and control system with the following objectives.
• Measure the cost of the resources consumed in performing the organization’s
significant activities.
• Identify and eliminate non-value-added costs. These are the costs of activities
that can be eliminated with no deterioration of product quality, performance, or
perceived value.
• Determine the efficiency and effectiveness of all major activities performed in
the enterprise.
• Identify and evaluate new activities that can improve the future performance of
the organization.
Notice the emphasis of a cost management system on the organization’s activities.
This emphasis, sometimes called activity accounting, is crucial to the goal of producing
quality goods and services at the lowest possible cost. In keeping with the focus on activi-
ties, managerial accountants have developed a system for determining the cost of produc-
ing goods or services called activity-based costing (ABC). In an ABC system, the costs
of the organization’s significant activities are accumulated and then assigned to goods or
services in accordance with how the activities are used in the production of those goods
and services. An ABC system helps management understand the causal linkages between
activities and costs.
Using an activity-based costing system to improve the operations of an organization
is called activity-based management, or ABM. We will have considerably more to say
about activity-based costing, activity-based management, and the role of cost manage-
ment systems throughout the text.
Strategic Cost Management and the Value Chain

are involved in securing basic raw materials and turning them into valuable products or
services. The set of linked, value-creating activities, ranging from securing basic raw Understand and explain the
materials and energy to the ultimate delivery of products and services, is called the value concepts of strategic cost

Mayo Clinic’s value chain, for example, would include not only the hospital but
also the suppliers of pharmaceutical products and medical supplies, the manufacturers
of diagnostic equipment, the private-practice physicians whose patients use the Mayo
Clinic, and the ambulance services that transport patients to the hospital.

The value chain for Walt Disney Studios would include upstream contributions such
as screenwriting, film studio construction and maintenance, set design and construc-
tion, costume design and production, travel arrangements for shooting scenes on loca-
tion, lighting technicians, film crews, and acting talent. Once the film has been produced,
the downstream contributions include advertising personnel; TV, radio, and print media;
film distributors; theater companies such as AMC Theaters; DVD producers; video rental
stores such as Hollywood Video; and DVD retailers such as Best Buy.
The major steps in the value chain for Gap Inc. are depicted in Exhibit 1–6. Gap,
Inc. is a major clothing retailer with over 3,100 stores worldwide. As Exhibit 1–6 shows,
major steps in Gap’s value chain include the following:
• Securing raw material, energy, and other resources.
• Research and development.
• Product design.
• Production.
• Marketing.
• Distribution and sales.
What is the role of Gap Inc. in this value chain? As the company’s Web site explains,
“We’re not a manufacturer. To produce our clothes, we contract with garment manufac-
turers around the world.” What Gap does is design its clothing lines, outsource the manu-
facturing, market the products, distribute them to retail stores where they are sold, and
provide customer service. Quoting again from Gap’s Web site, “From a design concept
born in New York by our product designers, to an in-store display in one of our more than
3,100 stores around the world, each Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy product goes
through a multistage process before reaching our customers.” That multistage process is
the company’s value chain.
In order for any organization to most effectively achieve its goals, it is important
for its managers to understand the entire value chain in which their organization par-
ticipates. This understanding can help managers ask, and answer, important questions
about their organization’s strategy. Should the company concentrate on only a narrow
link in the value chain, such as design or retailing? Or should it expand its operational
scope to include securing the raw materials or manufacturing the product? Are there

opportunities to form beneficial linkages with suppliers, which come earlier in the
value chain? Or with customers?
These questions involve fundamental, strategic issues about how an organization can
best meet its goals. Although many factors affect such decisions, one important factor
concerns the costs incurred in creating value in each link in the value chain. In order for
a company to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage, it must either (1) perform
one or more activities in the value chain at the same quality level as its competitors, but
at a lower cost, or (2) perform its value chain activities at a higher quality level than
its competitors, but at no greater cost. Understanding the value chain, and the factors
that cause costs to be incurred in each activity in the value chain, is a crucial step in the
development of a firm’s strategy. These cost-causing factors are called cost drivers, and
we will have much more to say about them throughout the text. The overall recognition
of the importance of cost relationships among the activities in the value chain, and the
process of managing those cost relationships to the firm’s advantage, is called strategic
cost management. Issues in strategic cost management will arise in a variety of contexts
as we pursue our study of managerial accounting.
Theory of Constraints Along with a value-chain analysis, managers should care-
fully examine the chain of linked activities with a view toward identifying the constraints
that prevent their organization from reaching a higher level of achievement. Sometimes
called the theory of constraints, this approach seeks to find the most cost-effective ways
to alleviate an organization’s most limiting constraints. When binding constraints are
relaxed, the organization can reach a higher level of goal attainment. For example, sup-
pose a delay occurred in the design process for Gap’s line of summer clothing because
too few designers were assigned to the project. This could result in a delay in contracting
for the manufacturing of the summer line, which could ultimately delay the delivery of
the products to Gap’s many retail outlets. In this context, the design process is a bottle-
neck operation, meaning that it slows down the progress of Gap’s products through the
retailer’s value chain. By assigning even one or two more designers to the summer cloth-
ing line, the delay could perhaps have been avoided.
The Ethical Climate of Business and the Role
of the Accountant

scandals that we have experienced over the past decade? Most recent among these was the
near total collapse of the U.S. and world banking and financial systems. And the headlines Understand the ethical respon-

blame? According to most observers, there is plenty of blame to go around: greedy cor-
porate executives, managers who make overreaching business deals, lack of oversight by
various companies’ boards of directors (particularly the boards’ audit committees), sub-
standard work by external auditors, lack of sufficient probing by Wall Street analysts and
the financial press, and some accountants who have been all too willing to push the enve-
lope on aggressive accounting to (or beyond) the edge. Billions of dollars have been lost in
employee pension funds, several states’ investment portfolios, and the private investment
accounts of the public. It will no doubt take many years to sort out the mess. Companies
have gone bankrupt; fortunes have been lost; careers have been ruined; and more of the
same is yet to come. Several financial executives have filed guilty pleas on felony charges.
Others have been convicted by juries. Some are serving time in prison. Some observers
have wondered if the confidence of the investing public can ever be regained.
One important lesson from these scandals is that not only is unethical behavior in busi-
ness wrong in a moral sense, but it also can be disastrous from the standpoint of the econ-
omy. We cannot have businesspeople lying, stealing, perpetrating frauds, and making up
accounting rules as they go without seriously disrupting business. Thus, ethical behavior by

businesspeople in general, and accountants in particular, is not a luxury or a discretionary
“good thing to do.” It is an absolute necessity to the smooth functioning of the economy.
Sorting out the details of the major scandals mentioned above would require a book
(or books) in itself and would take us well beyond the subject matter of this text. Most of
the purely accounting issues in these cases involve financial accounting (external report-
ing) rather than managerial accounting (internal reporting). In most companies, however,
many of the same individuals are involved in both types of accounting. In the notorious
Enron case, for example, investigators allege that a massive fraud was perpetrated on the
investing public by creating so-called related parties with names like Raptor for the sole
purpose of hiding debt and overstating earnings. Yet the same alleged fraud must have
been perpetrated on many at Enron itself. Surely not all of the company’s thousands of
employees knew of these accounting schemes. So ultimately, what may have been largely
financial (external) accounting misstatements almost certainly resulted in misstated man-
agerial (internal) accounting reports as well.13
The chaos in corporate governance and accounting spawned a movement for reform.
Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002, which, among other things, requires
companies to establish, assess, and regularly report on their internal controls over finan-
cial reporting. This legislation also created the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (PCAOB) to establish auditing standards and provide for an audit quality review
process. Appendix I covers the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and its implications for managerial
accounting. (Appendix I, on pages 766 through 771, can be assigned now.)
For many in the accounting profession, the scandals have served as a wake-up call to
concentrate more on ethical issues in practicing and teaching accounting.14 To this end,
a significant ethical issue in managerial accounting will be addressed at the end of most
chapters. The goal of these Focus on Ethics pieces is to raise the consciousness of stu-
dents that legitimate ethical issues do arise in the daily practice of managerial accounting.
In the last section of this chapter, we will turn our attention to managerial accounting as
a profession. In the context of that discussion, the Focus on Ethics piece for this chapter
will be a summary of the Institute of Management Accountants’ Statement of Ethical
Professional Practice.

American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Institute of Internal Auditors, and
the American Accounting Association.
The primary professional association for managerial accountants in Canada is the
Society of Management Accountants of Canada (La Société des Comptables en Manage-
ment du Canada). Great Britain’s main professional organization is the Institute of Char-
tered Management Accountants, and Australia’s organization is the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in Australia. In all, over 75 countries have professional organizations for
their practicing accountants.
Professional Certification
In keeping with the importance of their role and the specialized knowledge they must
have, managerial accountants can earn a professional certification. In the United States,
the IMA administers the Certified Management Accountant (CMA) program. The
requirements for becoming a Certified Management Accountant include meeting spec-
ified educational requirements and passing the CMA examination.15 In Canada, a mana-
gerial accountant may be certified as a Registered Industrial Accountant (RIA) by the
Society of Management Accountants of Canada. Great Britain and many other countries
also have professional certification programs for their managerial accountants.
Professional Ethics
As professionals, managerial accountants have an obligation to themselves, their colleagues,
and their organizations to adhere to high standards of ethical conduct. In recognition of this
obligation, the IMA has developed the following ethical standards for its members, who are
practitioners of managerial accounting and financial management.16 Note: Various prob-
lems and cases at the end of each chapter in this text include ethical issues to be resolved.
In addressing those issues, readers will need to refer to these ethical standards.

of the chapter.
LO2 Explain four fundamental management processes that help organizations attain their
goals. In pursuing its goals, an organization acquires resources, hires employees, and then engages
in an organized set of activities. It is up to the management team to make the best use of the organiza-
tion’s resources, employees, and activities in achieving the organization’s goals. The four fundamental
management processes are decision making, planning, directing operational activities, and controlling.
LO3 List and describe five objectives of managerial accounting activity. Five objectives of mana-
gerial accounting activity are (1) providing information for decision making and planning, and proac-
tively participating as part of the management team in the decision-making and planning processes; (2)
assisting managers in directing and controlling operations; (3) motivating managers and other employ-
ees to achieve the organization’s goals; (4) measuring the performance of activities, subunits, managers,
and other employees within the organization; and (5) assessing the organization’s competitive position
and working with other managers to ensure the organization’s long-run competitiveness in its industry.
LO4 Explain the major differences between managerial and financial accounting. The users of
managerial accounting information are managers inside the organization. Managerial accounting infor-
mation is not mandatory, is unregulated, and draws on data from the basic accounting system as well
as other data sources. The users of financial accounting information are interested parties outside the
organization. Financial accounting information is required, is regulated, and is based almost entirely on
historical transaction data.
LO5 Explain where managerial accountants are located in an organization, in terms of formal
organization, deployment in cross-functional teams, and physical location. Managerial accoun-
tants occupy staff positions in an organization chart. They are deployed as members of cross-functional
teams, which address a variety of managerial decisions. Managerial accountants are physically located
throughout an enterprise alongside the managers with whom they work closely.
LO6 Describe the roles of an organization’s chief financial officer (CFO) or controller, treasurer,
and internal auditor. The organization’s top managerial and financial accountant is called the chief finan-
cial officer or controller. The treasurer is responsible for raising capital and safeguarding the organization’s

assets. An organization’s internal auditor is responsible for reviewing the accounting procedures, records,
and reports and sometimes makes a broad performance evaluation of management.
LO7 Briefly describe some of the major contemporary themes in managerial accounting. Some
major themes in managerial accounting include its role in providing information and incentives, the
behavioral implications of managerial accounting information, the management of capacity and capac-
ity costs, the evolution and adaptation of the field, and the role of cost management systems. In manag-
ing capacity, it is important to distinguish between the cost of resources supplied, the cost of resources
used, and the cost of resources unused (i.e., the cost of unused capacity).
LO8 Understand and explain the concepts of strategic cost management and the value chain.
The value chain is the set of linked, value-creating activities, ranging from securing basic raw materials
and energy to the ultimate delivery of products and services. Understanding the value chain is a crucial
step in the development of an organization’s strategy. Managing the cost relationships in the value chain
to the organization’s advantage is called strategic cost management.
LO9 Understand the ethical responsibilities of a managerial accountant. Managerial accountants
are expected to display a commitment to ethical professional practice characterized by the overarching
principles of honesty, fairness, objectivity, and responsibility.
LO10 Discuss the professional organizations, certification process, and ethical standards in the
field of managerial accounting. As professionals, managerial accountants must successfully com-
plete a certification process and may enjoy the benefits of membership in one or more professional
organizations, such as the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA). They are expected to adhere to
the ethical standards of competence, confidentiality, integrity, and credibility.

moved to Montana to follow his dream of living in the mountains and Big Sky Country. Nelson, always Cross-Functional Teams;
the entrepreneur, began a sporting-goods store shortly after relocating. The single store soon grew to a E-Commerce
chain of four outlets throughout the sparsely populated state. As Nelson put it, “I can’t believe how fast (LO 5, 6, 7)
we’ve expanded. It’s basically uncontrolled growth—growth that has occurred in spite of what we’ve
done.”
Although business has been profitable, the chain did have its share of problems. Store traffic was
somewhat seasonal, with a slowdown occurring as winter approached. Nelson therefore added ski equip-

Part of Nelson’s operation focused on canoe building and white-water rafting trips. Reports from
the company’s financial accounting system seemed to indicate that these operations were losing money
because of increasing costs, although Nelson could not be sure. “The traditional income statement is not
too useful in assessing the problem,” he noted. “Also, my gut feeling is that we are not dealing with the
best suppliers in terms of quality of goods, delivery reliability, and prices.” Additional complications
were caused by an increasingly competitive marketplace, with many former customers now buying mer-
chandise and booking river excursions via the Internet, through catalogs received in the mail, or through
businesses that advertised heavily in outdoor magazines.
Nelson’s background is marketing, and he appeared somewhat puzzled on how to proceed. The
company’s chief financial officer (CFO) would be an obvious asset in terms of addressing these prob-
lems. Unfortunately, she knew her numbers but lacked key knowledge of general business operations.
The same could be said for other executives who managed somewhat in “silos,” becoming experts in a
narrow facet of the company but, in general, lacking a big-picture outlook for the firm.
Required:
1. Explain how the CFO and managerial accounting could assist Nelson in addressing the company’s
problems.
2. Would a cross-functional team be useful here? Briefly discuss.
3. Does e-commerce appear to be a viable option for the firm? Explain, citing the difference between
business-to-consumer and business-to-business channels. Which of the two channels, if any, would
you recommend? Why?

record profits for the rest of the airline industry. Management is somewhat set in its ways and could
probably use some “new blood,” as the most recent hire to the firm’s executive team was 12 years ago.
In Lopez’s first meeting with the team, the airline’s chief executive officer commented that “all that
mattered in this industry were load factors—the percentage of seats sold on scheduled flights. If load
factors were adequate, everything else would take care of itself.” Lopez noted that while this measure
was important, other, broader facets of operation were significant as well. She asked if any of the man-
agement team had heard of the balanced scorecard, and received dead silence as a response.

Based on her experiences with other engagements, including two that involved airlines, Lopez was
convinced that the balanced scorecard could provide benefits in helping to solve the airline’s woes. After
a presentation about the philosophy of the balanced scorecard, Four Corners Airlines’ management team
accepted her idea, feeling that a shift in operating philosophy was needed for survival.
Required:
1. What is a balanced scorecard, and what are its typical key elements?
2. Lopez wants to assemble a committee to prepare the airline’s balanced scorecard. List several of
the company’s functional areas (e.g., marketing) that should be represented on the committee.
3. Identify a number of measures to evaluate the key elements that you specified in requirement 1.
Measures would include items such as load factors, number of passenger complaints, percentage
of on-time arrivals, and so forth.
4. Do you see any problems with management’s prior focus on only one measure (i.e., load factor)?

analysis for the suggested change indicates that it is not economically feasible. AccuSound’s marketing
analyst has indicated that this problem will have a significant impact on the company’s reputation and
customer satisfaction. Consequently, the board of directors would interpret this problem as having seri-
ous negative implications for the company’s profitability.
Allen included the circuit failure and rework problem in her report prepared for the upcoming quar-
terly meeting of the board of directors. Due to the potential adverse economic impact, Allen followed a
long-standing practice of highlighting this information. After reviewing the reports to be presented, the
plant manager and his staff complained to the controller that he should control his people better. “We
can’t upset the board with this kind of material. Tell Allen to tone that down. Maybe we can get it by the
board in this meeting and have some time to work on it. People who buy those cheap systems and play
them that loud shouldn’t expect them to last forever.”
The controller called Allen into his office and said, “Marie, you’ll have to bury this one. The prob-
able failure of reworks can be mentioned briefly in the oral presentation, but it should not be mentioned
or highlighted in the advance material mailed to the board.”
Allen feels strongly that the board will be misinformed on a potentially serious loss of income if
she follows the controller’s orders. Allen discussed the problem with the quality control engineer, who
simply remarked, “That’s your problem, Marie.”
Required:
1. Discuss the ethical considerations that Marie Allen should recognize in deciding how to proceed.
2. Explain what ethical responsibilities should be accepted by (a) the controller, (b) the quality con-

management. The method of financial reporting from the division to corporate headquarters provides
further evidence of the degree of financial control. The division manager and the division controller
submit to corporate headquarters separate and independent commentary on the financial results of the

Andrea Nolan joined Progressive approximately one year ago as accounting manager. Nolan’s (LO 1, 3, 6, 9, 10)
duties include supervision of the company’s accounting operations and preparation of the company’s
financial statements. No one has noticed that in the past six months Progressive’s sales have ceased to
rise and have actually declined in the two most recent months. This unexpected downturn has resulted
in cash shortages. Compounding these problems, Progressive has had to delay the introduction of a new
product line due to delays in documentation preparation.
Progressive contracts most of its printing requirements to Web Graphic Inc., a small company
owned by Rob Borman. Borman has dedicated a major portion of his printing capacity to Progres-
sive’s requirements because Progressive’s contracts represent approximately 50 percent of Web
Graphic’s business. Nolan has known Borman for many years; as a matter of fact, she learned of
Progressive’s need for an accounting manager through Borman.
While preparing Progressive’s most recent financial statements, Nolan became concerned about
the company’s ability to maintain steady payments to its suppliers; she estimated that payments to all
vendors, normally made within 30 days, could exceed 75 days. Nolan is particularly concerned about
payments to Web Graphic; she knows that Progressive had recently placed a large order with Web
Graphic for the printing of the new product documentation, and she knows that Web Graphic will soon
be placing an order for the special paper required for Progressive’s documentation. Nolan is considering
telling Borman about Progressive’s cash problems; however, she is aware that a delay in the printing of
the documentation would jeopardize Progressive’s new product.
Required:
1. Describe Nolan’s ethical responsibilities in this situation.
2. Independent of your answer to requirement (1), assume that Nolan learns that Borman of Web
Graphic has decided to postpone the special paper order required for Progressive’s printing job;
Nolan believes Borman must have heard rumors about Progressive’s financial problems from some
other source because she has not talked to Borman. Should Nolan tell the appropriate Progressive
officials that Borman has postponed the paper order? Explain your answer.
3. Independent of your answers to the first two requirements, assume that Borman has decided to
postpone the special paper order because he has learned of Progressive’s financial problems from
some source other than Nolan. In addition, Nolan realizes that Jim Grason, Progressive’s purchas-
ing manager, knows of her friendship with Borman. Now Nolan is concerned that Grason may
suspect she told Borman of Progressive’s financial problems when Grason finds out Borman has
postponed the order. Describe the steps that Nolan should take to resolve this situation.

AFTER COMPLETING THIS CHAPTER, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
1 Explain what is meant by the word c ost.
2 Distinguish among product costs, period costs, and expenses.
3 Describe the role of costs in published financial statements.
4 List five types of manufacturing operations and describe mass customization.
5 Give examples of three types of manufacturing costs.
6 Prepare a schedule of cost of goods manufactured, a schedule of cost of goods
sold, and an income statement for a manufacturer.
7 Understand the importance of identifying an organization’s cost drivers.
8 Describe the behavior of variable and fixed costs, in total and on a per-unit basis.
9 Distinguish among direct, indirect, controllable, and uncontrollable costs.
10 Define and give examples of an opportunity cost, an out-of-pocket cost, a sunk
cost, a differential cost, a marginal cost, and an average cost.
The process of management involves formulating strategy, planning, control, decision
making, and directing operational activities. Managers can perform each of these func-
tions more effectively with managerial accounting information. Much of this informa-
tion focuses on the costs incurred in the organization. For example, in f ormulating its
overall strategy, Southwest Airlines’ management team considered the cost savings that
result from being a low-cost, no-frills airline. In planning Southwest’s routes and flight
schedules, managers must consider aircraft fuel costs, salaries of flight crews, and air-
port landing fees. Controlling the costs of manufacturing heavy equipment requires that
Caterpillar’s managerial accountants carefully measure and manage production costs. In
making decisions about locating a new store, Walmart managers need information about
the cost of building, maintaining, equipping, and staffing the store. Finally, to d irect oper-
ational activities, managers in all three of these companies need information about the
cost of salaries, utilities, security, and a host of other goods and services.
What Do We Mean by a Cost?
Each of the examples in the preceding paragraph focuses on costs of one type or another.

At the most basic level, a cost may be defined as the sacrifice made, usually mea-
sured by the resources given up, to achieve a particular purpose. If we look more care-
fully, though, we find that the word cost can have different meanings depending on the
context in which it is used. Cost data that are classified and recorded in a particular way
for one purpose may be inappropriate for another use. For example, the costs incurred
in producing gasoline last year are important in measuring ExxonMobil’s income for
the year. However, those costs may not be useful in planning the company’s refinery

A n important issue in both managerial and financial accounting is the timing with which
the costs of acquiring assets or services are recognized as expenses. An expense is
defined as the cost incurred when an asset is used up or sold for the purpose of generat-

which various expenses are recognized. Distinguish among product

or merchandise until the goods are sold. In the period of the sale, the product costs are
recognized as an expense called c ost of goods sold. The product cost of merchandise
inventory acquired by a retailer or wholesaler for resale consists of the purchase cost of
the inventory plus any shipping charges. The product cost of manufactured inventory
includes all of the costs incurred in its manufacture. For example, the labor cost of a
production employee at Texas Instruments is included as a product cost of the calcula-
tors manufactured. Exhibit 2–1 illustrates the relationship between product costs and
cost-of-goods-sold expense.

Year 1 Year 2 Time
Period costs are treated the
same way in all types of
companies: retailers and
wholesalers, manufacturers,
and service industry firms.
A nother term for product cost is inventoriable cost, since a product cost is stored
as the cost of inventory until the goods are sold. In addition to retailers, wholesalers, and
manufacturers, the concept of product cost is relevant to other producers of inventoriable
goods. Agricultural firms, lumber companies, and mining firms are examples of nonman-
ufacturers that produce inventoriable goods. Apples, timber, coal, and other such goods
are inventoried at their product cost until the time period during which they are sold.
A ll costs that are not product costs are called period costs. These costs are identified
with the period of time in which they are incurred rather than with units of purchased or
produced goods. Period costs are recognized as expenses during the time period in which
they are incurred. All research and development, selling, and administrative costs are
treated as period costs. This is true in manufacturing, retail, and service industry firms.
Research and development costs include all costs of developing new products and
services. The costs of running laboratories, building prototypes of new products, and test-
ing new products are all classified as research and development (or R&D) costs. Selling
costs include salaries, commissions, and travel costs of sales personnel and the costs of
advertising and promotion. A dministrative costs refer to all costs of running the organiza-
tion as a whole. The salaries of top-management personnel and the costs of the account-
ing, legal, and public relations activities are examples of administrative costs.
Exhibit 2–2 illustrates the nature of period costs.
Costs on Financial Statements
The distinction between product costs and period costs is emphasized by examining
Learning Objective 3
financial statements from three different types of firms.
Describe the role of costs in
published financial statements. Income Statement
Exhibit 2–3 displays recent income statements, in highly summarized form, from South-
west Airlines Company, Caterpillar, Inc., and Walmart Stores, Inc. These companies are
from three different industries. Representing the service industry is Southwest Airlines,
a major airline based in the southwestern United States. Caterpillar is a heavy equip-
ment manufacturer. Walmart Stores is a large retail firm with merchandising operations
throughout most of the nation.
S elling and administrative costs are always period costs on any type of company’s
income statement. For example, Caterpillar lists $3.19 billion of selling, general, and
administrative expenses on its income statement in Exhibit 2–3 .

F or Caterpillar, the costs of manufactured inventory are product costs. All costs
incurred in manufacturing finished products are stored in inventory until the time period
when the products are sold. Then the product costs of the inventory sold become cost of
goods sold, an expense on the income statement.

order and delivered directly to customers, who get the exact machines they want cheaper
than they can get them from Dell’s competition. “Dell has some 24 facilities in and around
Austin and employs more than 18,000 local workers. Michael Dell, the company’s rest-
less founder, is constantly looking for ways to improve the company’s operations.” 2 In
one year alone, Dell cut $1 billion out of its costs—half from manufacturing—and Dell
executives vowed to cut another $1 billion.
At the Topfer Manufacturing Center in Austin, workers “scuttle about in the
200,000-square-foot plant like ants on a hot plate. Gathered in cramped six-person ‘cells,’
they assemble computers from batches of parts that arrive via a computer-directed con-
veyor system overhead. If a worker encounters a problem, that batch can instantly be
shifted to another cell, avoiding the stoppages that plague conventional assembly lines.
Dell is constantly tinkering with factory layout and product design to move computers
through at a higher velocity.”
In spite of the ups and downs of the computer technology industry, most observers
believe that Dell’s business model will continue to be successful. However, the company
has acknowledged that it needs to upgrade its tech support services in order to better
serve its customers. 3
Recently, Michael Dell has charted a change in course for Dell, by seeking to acquire
companies that can help Dell compete more effectively with rivals Hewlett-Packard, I BM,
and Apple. Through structured acquisitions, Dell hopes to better position itself as “the
center of the tech industry has shifted from the PC to the Internet.” 4

Mass-Customization Manufacturing
In a mass-customization manufacturing environment, many standardized components
are combined in different ways to produce custom-made products to customer order.
Dell Inc. and Gateway are prime examples of mass customizers. Such companies are
characterized by high production volume and often use a d irect-sales approach, in which

computer parts such as motherboards, computer chips, and power units and then assem-
bles these parts into customized personal computers to customer specifications. A fin-
ished computer is then packaged with the monitor, keyboard, printer, and cables ordered
by the customer, all of which are purchased by Comet.
The direct-sales model, which was popularized by Dell Inc. is used. Ninety percent
of Comet’s orders are placed on the company’s website, cometcomp.com, and 10 percent
are taken on an a toll-free phone number. No sales are made through retail channels.
Comet’s production process is triggered when a customer places an order, either on
the company’s website, cometcomp.com, or on its toll-free phone line. The customer
specifies every aspect of the desired computer system, including the type of processor
and amount of memory in the hard drive, the size of the monitor and type of printer, and
finally any preinstalled software. Either a Web or a phone sales representative transmits
the order electronically to the appropriate production cell module.6 A production cell
module, or mod, is responsible for manufacturing a particular product line, such as a
desktop computer, laptop, or server. When the order is received in the appropriate mod,
the assembly process begins. Memory and processor chips are installed in the mother-
board, which is then mounted on the chassis. Then such components as the CD-ROM

Before we discuss Comet’s production process further, let’s turn our attention to the
types of manufacturing costs incurred by Comet and other manufacturers.

accountants classify costs by the functional area of the organization to which costs relate.
Some examples of functional areas are manufacturing, marketing, administration, and Give examples of three types of

three categories: direct material, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.
Direct Material Raw material that is consumed in the manufacturing process, is
physically incorporated in the finished product, and can be traced to products relatively
easily is called d irect material. Examples include the sheet metal in a Subaru automo-
bile and the semiconductors in a Comet computer.
Some students are confused by the seemingly interchangeable use of the terms r aw
material and direct material. However, there is a difference in the meaning of these terms.
Before material is entered into the production process, it is called r aw material. A fter it
enters production, it becomes d irect material.
Direct Labor The cost of salaries, wages, and fringe benefits for personnel who
work directly on the manufactured products is classified as d irect-labor cost. Examples
include the wages of personnel who assemble Comet computers and who operate the
equipment in a Royal Dutch Shell refinery.
The cost of fringe benefits for direct-labor personnel, such as employer-paid health-
insurance premiums and the employer’s pension contributions, also should be classified
as direct-labor costs.

46 Chapter 2 Basic Cost Management Concepts and Accounting for Mass Customization Operations
Manufacturing Overhead All other costs of manufacturing are classified as
manufacturing overhead, which includes three types of costs: indirect material, indirect
labor, and other manufacturing costs.
Indirect Material The cost of materials that are required for the production process
but do not become an integral part of the finished product are classified as indirect mate-
rial costs. An example is the cost of drill bits used in a metal-fabrication department at
F ord Motor Company. The drill bits wear out and are discarded, but they do not become
part of the product. Materials that do become an integral part of the finished product
but are insignificant in cost are also often classified as indirect material. Materials such
as glue or paint may be so inexpensive that it is not worth tracing their costs to specific
products as direct materials.
Indirect Labor The costs of personnel who do not work directly on the product, but
whose services are necessary for the manufacturing process, are classified as i ndirect

manufacturing firms, departments are referred to as work centers.
Chrysler
Other manufacturing overhead costs include overtime premiums and the cost of
idle time. An overtime premium is the extra compensation paid to an employee who
works beyond the time normally scheduled. Suppose a technician who assembles
Comet computers earns $16 per hour. The technician works 48 hours during a week
instead of the scheduled time of 40 hours. The overtime pay scale is time and a half,
or 150 percent of the regular wage. The technician’s compensation for the week is
classified as follows:
Direct-labor cost ($16 " 48) ................................................................................................................................. $768
Overhead (overtime premium: ½ " $16 " 8) ......................................................................................................... 64
Total compensation paid ......................................................................................................................................... $832
Only the e xtra compensation of $8 per hour is classified as overtime premium. The regu-
lar wage of $16 per hour is treated as direct labor, even for the eight overtime hours.
Idle time is time that is not spent productively by an employee due to such events as
equipment breakdowns or new setups of production runs. Such idle time is an unavoid-
able feature of most manufacturing processes. The cost of an employee’s idle time is
classified as overhead so that it may be spread across all production jobs, rather than
being associated with a particular production job. Suppose that during one 40-hour shift,
a machine breakdown resulted in idle time of 1½ hours and a power failure idled workers
for an additional ½ hour. If an employee earns $14 per hour, the employee’s wages for the
week will be classified as follows:
Direct-labor cost ($14 " 38) .................................................................................................................................. $532
Overhead (idle time: $14 " 2) ................................................................................................................................ 28
Total compensation paid ......................................................................................................................................... $560

================================================================================
PAGE 82
================================================================================

Chapter 2 Basic Cost Management Concepts and Accounting for Mass Customization Operations 47
Overtime premiums and the cost of idle time should be classified as manufacturing
overhead, rather than associated with a particular production job, because the particular
job on which idle time or overtime may occur tends to be selected at random. Sup-
pose several production jobs are scheduled during an eight-hour shift, and the last job
remains unfinished at the end of the shift. The overtime to finish the last job is neces-
sitated by all of the jobs scheduled during the shift, not just the last one. Similarly, if a
power failure occurs during one of several production jobs, the idle time that results is
not due to the job that happens to be in process at the time. The power failure is a ran-
dom event, and the resulting cost should be treated as a cost of all of the department’s
production.
To summarize, manufacturing costs include direct material, direct labor, and manu-
facturing overhead. Direct labor and overhead are often called conversion costs, since
they are the costs of “converting” raw material into finished products. Direct material and
direct labor are often referred to as p rime costs.
Manufacturing Cost Flows
Direct material, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead are the three types of produc-
tion costs incurred by manufacturers. These costs are product costs because they are
stored in inventory until the time period when the manufacturer’s products are sold. Man-
ufacturers have product-costing systems to keep track of the flow of these costs from the
time production begins until finished products are sold. This flow of manufacturing costs
is depicted in Exhibit 2–6 . As direct material is consumed in production, its cost is added
to work-in-process inventory. Similarly, the costs of direct labor and manufacturing over-
head are accumulated in work in process.

manufacturing overhead transferred from work-in-process inventory to finished-goods
inventory is called the cost of goods manufactured. The costs then are stored in finished Boeing
goods until the time period when the products are sold. At that time, the product costs are
transferred from finished goods to cost of goods sold, which is an expense of the period
when the sale is made. Exhibit 2–6 concentrates on the conceptual basis of a product- Learning Objective 6

these two schedules along with an income statement for Comet Computer Corporation. 7
Notice the extremely low inventories of raw material, finished goods, and work in pro-
cess in these schedules. With annual sales of $700 million, Comet’s year-end inventory
of raw material is only $5,020,000, which is less than 1 percent of sales. Work-in-process
inventory ($100,000) and finished-goods inventory ($190,000) are even lower. These low
inventories, relative to sales volume, are characteristic of mass customizers using the
direct-sales approach.
Production Costs in Service Industry Firms
and Nonprofit Organizations
Service industry firms and many nonprofit organizations are also engaged in produc-
tion. What distinguishes these organizations from manufacturers is that a service is con-
sumed as it is produced, whereas a manufactured product can be stored in inventory.
Such businesses as Westin Hotels, Bank of America, United Airlines, the Chicago Bulls,
and Cole Muffler are in the business of producing services. Similarly, nonprofit organi-

zations such as the American Red Cross and the Greater Miami Opera Association also
are engaged in service production. While less commonly observed in service firms, the
same cost classifications used in manufacturing companies can be applied. For example,
Air France produces air transportation services. Direct material includes such costs as jet
fuel, aircraft parts, and food and beverages. Direct labor includes the salaries of the flight
crew and the wages of aircraft-maintenance personnel. Overhead costs include deprecia-
tion of baggage-handling equipment, insurance, and airport landing fees.
The process of recording and classifying costs is important in service industry firms
and nonprofit organizations for the same reasons as in manufacturing firms. Cost analysis
is used in pricing banking and insurance services, locating travel and car-rental agen-
cies, setting enrollment targets in universities, and determining cost reimbursements in
hospitals. As such organizations occupy an ever-growing role in our economy, applying
managerial accounting to their activities will take on ever-greater importance.

Basic Cost Management Concepts: Different Costs
for Different Purposes
An understanding of cost concepts is absolutely critical to cost management. Moreover,
different perspectives on costs are important in different managerial situations. The
phrase d ifferent costs for different purposes is often used to convey the notion that differ-
ent characteristics of costs can be important to understand in a variety of managerial cir-
cumstances. In this section, we will briefly discuss the work of several cross-functional
management teams at Comet Computer Corporation, each of which is focusing on a
particular management challenge. Through our discussion of these cost management
teams’ work, we will explore some of the key cost terms and concepts used in manage-
rial accounting and cost management.
The Cost Driver Team
One of the most important cost classifications involves the way a cost changes in relation

to changes in the activity of the organization. A ctivity refers to a measure of the organiza-

identifying an organization’s Motors, the number of days of patient care provided by Massachusetts General Hospital,
cost drivers. and the number of insurance claims settled by Allstate are all measures of activity. The
activities that cause costs to be incurred are also called c ost drivers.
One of Comet Computer Corporation’s cost management teams
was formed to examine the various costs incurred by Comet. The
team consisted of an engineer, a production manager, a purchasing
manager, and a managerial accountant. After identifying the various
costs incurred by Comet, the team was charged to go on to iden-
tify the cost drivers upon which various types of costs depend. 8 A
cost driver is a characteristic of an activity or event that causes costs
to be incurred by that activity or event. In most organizations, dif-
ferent types of costs respond to widely differing cost drivers. For
example, in a manufacturing firm, the cost of assembly labor would
be driven by the quantity of products manufactured as well as the
number of parts in each product. In contrast, the cost of machine
setup labor would be driven by the number of production runs. The
cost of material-handling labor would be driven by material-related
factors such as the quantity and cost of raw material used, the num-
ber of parts in various products, and the number of raw-material
shipments received.
In identifying a cost driver, the managerial accountant should
consider the extent to which a cost or pool of costs varies in accor-
dance with the cost driver. The higher the correlation between the
cost and the cost driver, the more -accurate will be the resulting
understanding of cost behavior. Another important consideration

is the cost of measuring the cost driver. Thus, there is a cost-

increases, the accuracy of the resulting information will increase.
However, the cost of the information will increase also. The con-
cept of a cost driver will be an important aspect of many of the topics discussed in
subsequent chapters.
8 Such cost driver teams have been established by many companies. For descriptions of such efforts at Deere
and Company and Hewlett-Packard Corporation, see the management cases: John Deere Component Works and
Hewlett-Packard-Queensferry Telecommunications Division (Harvard Business School).

Variable and Fixed Costs
After identifying costs and cost drivers for Comet Computer Corporation’s operations,
Learning Objective 8
the cost driver team went on to examine the relationship of various costs to the activities
performed. Such a relationship is referred to as cost behavior and will be the focus of Describe the behavior of
Chapter 7. At this juncture, though, let’s look at two types of cost behavior identified at variable and fixed costs, in
Comet Computer Corporation: variable and fixed costs. total and on a per-unit basis.
Variable Costs A v ariable cost changes in total in direct proportion to a change in
the level of activity (or cost driver). If activity increases by 20 percent, total variable cost
increases by 20 percent also. For example, the cost of sheet metal used by Chrysler will
increase by approximately 5 percent if automobile production increases by 5 percent. The
cost of napkins and other paper products used at a Pizza Hut will increase by roughly 10
percent if the restaurant’s patronage increases by 10 percent.
At Comet Computer Corporation, the cost management team identified direct mate-
rial as a variable cost. One purchased component, a power bus assembly, costs $100 per
computer manufactured. The cost behavior for this direct material cost is graphed and
tabulated in Exhibit 2–8 .
Panel A of Exhibit 2–8 displays a graph of this variable cost. As this graph shows,
total variable cost increases proportionately with activity. When activity doubles, from
10 to 20 units, total variable cost doubles, from $1,000 to $2,000. However, the variable
cost p er unit remains the same as activity changes. The variable cost associated with each
unit of activity is $100, whether it is the first unit, the fourth, or the eighteenth. The table
in panel B of Exhibit 2–8 illustrates this point.
To summarize, as activity changes, total variable cost increases or decreases propor-
tionately with the activity change, but unit variable cost remains the same.

52 Chapter 2 Basic Cost Management Concepts and Accounting for Mass Customization Operations
Fixed Costs A f ixed cost remains unchanged in total as the level of activity (or cost
driver) varies. If activity increases or decreases by 20 percent, total fixed cost remains the
same. Examples of fixed costs include depreciation of plant and equipment at a Nike fac-
tory, the cost of property taxes at a Ramada Inn, and the salary of a subway train operator
employed by the New York Transit Authority.
Comet Computer Corporation’s cost driver team identified the salary of the manager
of Web sales operations as a fixed cost. Her $150,000 annual salary does not vary with
the number of units produced or sold.
This fixed cost is graphed in panel A of Exhibit 2–9 .
From the graph in Exhibit 2–9 , it is apparent that t otal fixed cost remains unchanged
as activity changes. When activity triples, from 10 to 30 units, total fixed cost remains
constant at $150,000. However, the fixed cost per unit does change as activity changes.
If the activity level is only 1 unit, then the fixed cost per unit is $150,000 per unit
($150,000 ! 1). If the activity level is 10 units, then the fixed cost per unit declines to
$15,000 per unit ($150,000 ! 10). The behavior of total fixed cost and unit fixed cost is
illustrated by the table in panel B of Exhibit 2–9 .
Another way of viewing the change in unit fixed cost as activity changes is in a graph,
as shown in panel C of Exhibit 2–9 . Unit fixed cost declines steadily as activity increases.
Notice that the decrease in unit fixed cost when activity changes from 1 to 2 units is much
larger than the decrease in unit fixed cost when activity changes from 10 to 11 units or
from 20 to 21 units. Thus, the amount of the change in unit fixed cost declines as the
activity level increases.
To summarize, as the activity level increases, total fixed cost remains constant but
unit fixed cost declines. As you will see in subsequent chapters, it is vital in manage-
rial accounting to thoroughly understand the behavior of both total fixed costs and unit
fixed costs.
The Cost Management and Control Team
An important objective of managerial accounting is to assist managers in managing
and controlling costs. Sometimes cost management is facilitated by tracing costs to the
department or work center in which the cost was incurred. Such tracing of costs to depart-
ments is known as r esponsibility accounting.
Comet Computer Corporation formed a cost management and control team to refine
the company’s responsibility accounting system. The team consisted of an engineer, the
production scheduling manager, the assistant manager of quality control, the manager of
human resources, and a managerial accountant. The ultimate objective of the team was
to develop a responsibility accounting system that would assist management in manag-
ing and controlling costs as well as reducing costs whenever possible. We will study cost
management systems and cost reduction in considerable detail in Chapter 5 and responsi-
bility accounting in Chapter 12. For now, let’s focus on a couple of cost concepts that are
useful in these areas of managerial accounting.
Direct and Indirect Costs An entity, such as a particular product, service, or
department, to which a cost is assigned is called a cost object. A cost that can be traced
to a particular cost object is called a d irect cost of that cost object.
For example, the salary of an auto mechanic is a direct cost of the automotive service

department in a Sears department store. The cost of paint used in the painting department
Distinguish among direct, of a Toyota plant is a direct cost of the painting department.
indirect, controllable, and A cost that is not directly traceable to a particular cost object is called an i ndirect cost

indirect costs of each of the departments or subunits of the recreational complex, such as
the Magic Kingdom and Epcot. The salary of a General Electric Company plant manager is

“Low-cost carriers now account for nearly 20 percent of U.S. domestic air capacity.
A second force behind the fundamental shift in airline economics is the Internet, which
has given travelers, travel agents, and corporate travel managers powerful tools to find
and take advantage of deeply discounted fares.
“The shift is dire news for the big airlines, the full-service retailers of flight. The carri-
ers, which are bleeding red ink, have massive fixed costs that aren’t easy to scale back.
Most of them have built expensive hub-and-spoke route systems and signed costly
labor contracts that they had hoped to finance by charging high-margin business fares.
But now, there is ‘a low-fare network in this country that did not exist previously.’ A
senior vice president at Continental Airlines told a recent aviation conference, ‘We’ve finally
reached the point, perhaps, where [its] penetration may be fatal’ to the major carriers’
high-cost business models.
“Some carriers, including American Airlines and United Airlines, are now rethinking their
entire operations, even considering whether they should cut back their high-cost route
systems.” At American, “a special task force is hunting for immediate money-saving
ideas and another is studying longer-range restructuring.”
It won’t be easy, however, for major airlines to cut their costs. “Consider the cur-
rent advantages low-fare carriers have over full-service rivals. They tend to have younger
fleets, which require less maintenance, and younger labor forces that aren’t tied to com-
plicated, inefficient labor contracts. That’s why labor costs are equivalent to just 25 per-
cent of revenue at discounters Air-Tran Airways, Frontier Airlines, and JetBlue and 30 percent
at Southwest. At United and Delta, labor costs exceed 40 percent of revenue. Moreover,
low-fare carriers typically stick to one airplane model, thus minimizing maintenance,
operating, and training costs.” Many of the biggest carriers still fly six or seven types of
aircraft. 9
The bottom line is that the airline industry is undergoing a sea-change in its business
model, and it is driven by the very different cost structures that characterize the largest
carriers versus their smaller discount competitors. The discounters are more flexible and
have proportionately lower fixed costs. An understanding of the cost drivers in the industry
will be crucial to the survival of the big airlines.

Chapter 2 Basic Cost Management Concepts and Accounting for Mass Customization Operations 55
Comet Computer Corporation’s cost management and control team determined that
many of the company’s costs were traceable to various departments or to specific activi-
ties of those departments. In the purchasing department, for example, costs were traced
not just to the department, but to the specific activities of identifying vendors, qualifying
vendors, securing design specifications from the engineering design department, nego-
tiating prices, placing orders, expediting orders, receiving materials and components,
inspecting materials, and releasing materials to the material-handling operation.
An important objective of a cost management system is to trace as many costs as
possible directly to the activities that cause them to be incurred. Sometimes called a ctiv-
ity accounting, this process is vital to management’s objective of eliminating n on-value-
added costs. These are costs of activities that can be eliminated without deterioration of
product quality, performance, or perceived value. (We will study the elimination of non-
value-added costs in greater detail in Chapter 5.)
Controllable and Uncontrollable Costs Another cost classification that can
be helpful in cost control involves the controllability of a cost item by a particular man-
ager. If a manager can control or heavily influence the level of a cost, then that cost is
classified as a controllable cost of that manager. Costs that a manager cannot influence
significantly are classified as uncontrollable costs of that manager. Many costs are not
completely under the control of any individual. In classifying costs as controllable or
uncontrollable, managerial accountants generally focus on a manager’s ability to influ-
ence costs. The question is not, Who controls the cost? but, Who is in the best position to
influence the level of a cost item? Exhibit 2–10 lists several cost items along with their
typical classification as controllable or uncontrollable.
Comet Computer’s cost management and control team was able to designate many
of Comet’s costs as controllable or uncontrollable by various managers. Take the cost of
raw materials and components, for example. The team determined that the q uantity of
materials used was largely controllable by the production supervisor, but the price of the
materials was influenced more by the purchasing manager.
The Outsourcing Action Team
Another of Comet Computer Corporation’s interdisciplinary management teams
was formed to take a close look at which of the raw materials and components used
in Comet’s products should be manufactured by Comet and which ones should be
outsourced (purchased from outside vendors). 10 This team consisted of the assistant

mation is relevant to the decisions faced by the organization’s managers. Several of the
most important economic cost concepts are discussed next.
Opportunity Costs An o pportunity cost is defined as the benefit that is sacri-
ficed when the choice of one action precludes taking an alternative course of action. If
beef and fish are the available choices for dinner, the opportunity cost of eating beef is the
forgone pleasure associated with eating fish.
Opportunity costs arise in many business decisions. For example, suppose a base-
ball manufacturer receives a special order for softballs from the city of Boston. If
the firm accepts the softball order, it will not have enough productive capacity (labor
and machine time) to produce its usual output of baseballs for sale to a large chain
of sporting-goods stores. The opportunity cost of accepting the softball order is the
forgone benefit from the baseball production that cannot be achieved. This forgone
benefit is measured by the potential revenue from the baseball sales minus the cost of
manufacturing the baseballs.
Opportunity costs also arise in personal decisions. The opportunity cost of a stu-
dent’s college education includes the salary that is forgone as a result of not taking a
full-time job during the student’s years in college.
From an economic perspective, a dollar of opportunity cost associated with an action
should be treated as equivalent to a dollar of out-of-pocket cost. O ut-of-pocket costs are
those that require the payment of cash or other assets as a result of their incurrence. The
out-of-pocket costs associated with the softball order consist of the manufacturing costs
required to produce the softballs. In making the decision to accept or reject the softball
order, the firm’s management should consider b oth the out-of-pocket cost and the oppor-
tunity cost of the order.
Studies by behavioral scientists and economists have shown that many people have a
tendency to ignore or downplay the importance of opportunity costs. For example, in one
study people were asked if they would pay $500 for two tickets to the Super Bowl. Most
people responded that they would not. However, many of the same people said that they
would not sell the Super Bowl tickets for $500 if they were given the tickets free of charge.
These people refused to incur the $500 out-of-pocket cost of buying the Super Bowl tickets.
However, they were willing to incur the $500 opportunity cost of going to the game rather
than sell the tickets. In each case, a couple that attends the game ends up $500 poorer than a
couple that does not attend the game. (Try surveying your friends with this scenario.)
Behavior such as that illustrated in the Super Bowl example is economically incon-
sistent. Ignoring or downplaying the importance of opportunity costs can result in incon-
sistent and faulty business decisions.
Comet Computer’s outsourcing action team found that the opportunity cost of using
constrained production resources (such as space, machine time, and employee time) to
produce a computer component in-house was an important factor to consider in deciding
whether to outsource the component.1 1
Sunk Costs Sunk costs are costs that have been incurred in the past. Consequently,
they do not affect future costs and cannot be changed by any current or future action.
11 The details of the outsourcing decision, including its relevant costs and the role of opportunity costs, are covered
in Chapter 14.

Chapter 2 Basic Cost Management Concepts and Accounting for Mass Customization Operations 57
Examples of such costs include the acquisition cost of equipment previously purchased
and the manufacturing cost of inventory on hand. Regardless of the current usefulness
of the equipment or the inventory, the costs of acquiring them cannot be changed by any
prospective action. Hence, these costs are irrelevant to all future decisions.
Suppose, for example, that a university’s traffic department purchased a desktop
computer to assist in the vehicle registration process. A year has passed, the com-
puter’s warranty has expired, and the computer is not working well. An investiga-
tion reveals that this brand of computer is very sensitive to humidity and temperature
changes. The traffic department is located in an old building with poor heating and
no air-conditioning. As a result, the computer works only intermittently, repair bills
have been high, and the office staff is fed up. The office manager requests that the
department director junk the computer and instruct the staff to return to the old manual
registration system. The director responds by insisting, “We can’t afford to junk the
computer! We paid $3,400 for it.”
This illustration is a typical example of the inappropriate attention paid to sunk costs.
The $3,400 paid for the computer is sunk. No future decision about the computer or the
office’s procedures can affect that cost. Future decisions should be based on future costs,
such as the computer repair bills or the costs of upgrading the building’s heating and air-
conditioning systems.
Although it is incorrect, from an economic perspective, to allow sunk costs to affect
future decisions, people often do so. It is human nature to attempt to justify past deci-
sions. When there is a perceived need to demonstrate competence, either to themselves or
to others, managers may seek to justify their decisions. The response of the traffic depart-
ment director that “We can’t afford to junk the computer!” may represent the director’s
need to justify the past decision to purchase the computer. It is important for managerial
accountants to be aware of such behavioral tendencies. Such an awareness enables the
accountant to prepare the most relevant data for managers’ decisions and, sometimes, to
assist the managers in using the information.
Comet Computer’s outsourcing action team encountered a sunk cost as it consid-
ered outsourcing production of a component called a monitor interface unit (MIU).
The team discovered that the automatic insertion robot used to insert components into
the MIU was difficult to maintain and expensive to operate. Nevertheless, the depart-
ment supervisor was inclined to keep the robot and continue in-house production of
the MIU, because, as he put it, “Comet paid an arm and a leg for this robot.” The team
was able to demonstrate that the robot’s acquisition cost was a sunk cost and was
irrelevant to the outsourcing decision. We will explore sunk costs in more detail in
Chapter 14.
Differential Costs A differential cost is the amount by which the cost differs
under two alternative actions. Suppose, for example, that a county government is consid-
ering two competing sites for a new landfill. If the northern site is chosen, the annual cost
of transporting refuse to the site is projected at $85,000. If the southern site is selected,
annual transportation charges are expected to be $70,000. The annual differential cost of
transporting refuse is calculated as follows:
Annual cost of transporting refuse to northern site ................................................................................................ $85,000
Annual cost of transporting refuse to southern site ................................................................................................ 70,000
Annual differential cost ........................................................................................................................................ $15,000
The increase in cost from one alternative to another is called an incremental cost.
In the landfill example, the annual incremental cost of refuse transportation is $15,000
if the site is moved from the southern location to the northern location. Differential
or incremental costs are found in a variety of economic decisions. The additional cost

================================================================================

58 Chapter 2 Basic Cost Management Concepts and Accounting for Mass Customization Operations
incurred by Gulliver’s Travels, a travel agency, in locating a new office in the suburbs
is the incremental cost of the new business location. The difference in the total cost
incurred by the travel agency with or without the suburban location is the differential
cost of the decision whether to establish the new office. Decisions about establishing
new airline routes, adding additional shifts in a manufacturing firm, or increasing the
nursing staff in a hospital all involve differential costs.
At Comet Computer, the outsourcing action team estimated that the differential cost
between outsourcing the production of the MIU (monitor interface unit) and producing
it in-house would be $200,000 annually in favor of outsourcing, based on current projec-
tions of annual production.
Marginal Costs and Average Costs A special case of the differential-cost
concept is the marginal cost, which is the extra cost incurred when one additional unit
is produced. The additional cost incurred by Comet Computer when one additional high-
performance laptop computer is made is the marginal cost of manufacturing the com-
puter. The table in Exhibit 2–11 shows how marginal cost can change across different
ranges of production quantities.
Marginal costs typically differ across different ranges of production quantities
because the efficiency of the production process changes. At Comet Computer, the
marginal cost of producing a laptop computer declines as output increases. It is
much more efficient for the company to manufacture 101 computers than to make
only one.
It is important to distinguish between marginal costs and average costs. In the Comet
Computer example, the marginal cost of the second computer is $1,900. However, the
average cost per unit when two laptops are manufactured is $3,900 divided by 2, or
$1,950. Similarly, the marginal cost of the eleventh laptop is $1,690, but the average cost
per unit when 11 laptops are produced is $1,790 (calculated by dividing $19,690 by 11).
What is the marginal cost of the 101st laptop computer? The average cost per unit when
101 laptops are manufactured?1 2
To summarize, the marginal cost of production is the extra cost incurred when one
more unit is produced. The average cost per unit is the total cost, for whatever quantity
is manufactured, divided by the number of units manufactured. Marginal costs and aver-
age costs arise in a variety of economic situations. A Princeton University administra-
tor might be interested in the marginal cost of educating one additional student, and a
Toyota executive might want to know the marginal cost of producing one more Toyota
van. A Greyhound route manager might be interested in the average cost per mile on the
Pittsburgh to New York City route.
12 Marginal cost of 101st laptop computer is $995 (from Exhibit 2–11 ). Average cost per unit when 101 laptops are
produced is $1,495 ($150,995 ! 101).

Costs and Benefits of Information
Many different cost concepts have been explored in this chapter. An important task of the
managerial accountant is to determine which of these cost concepts is most appropriate “If you can’t communicate

facilitates. Abbott Labs
Another important task of the managerial accountant is to weigh the benefits of pro-
viding information against the costs of generating, communicating, and using that infor-
mation. Some accountants, eager to show that they have not overlooked anything, tend
to provide too much information. But when managers receive more data than they can
utilize effectively, i nformation overload occurs. Struggling to process large amounts of
information, managers may be unable to recognize the most important facts. In deciding
how much and what type of information to provide, managerial accountants should con-
sider these human limitations.
Costs in the Service Industry
The cost terms and concepts that we have studied in this chapter are just as relevant in
the service industry as in a manufacturing firm like Comet Computer Corporation. Here
we will explore those cost issues in the context of a well-known automotive service
company.
Midas, Inc. is one of the world’s largest providers of automotive service, including
exhaust system, brakes, steering, suspension, and routine maintenance services. There
are more than 1,600 franchised and company-owned Midas locations in the United States
and Canada and over 800 licensed and franchised locations in 14 other countries on five
continents. In recent years, Midas has undergone some significant changes. First, the
company intentionally transitioned from an under-car repair specialist to a full-service
automotive repair and maintenance provider. Second, Midas has sold its exhaust system
manufacturing business to concentrate fully on automotive service provision. To this end,
Midas has established relationships with automobile parts vendors who distribute their
products directly to Midas auto service shops.
A typical Midas automotive maintenance and repair shop has approximately 4,000
square feet and six service bays. A company-owned shop usually is staffed with a man-
ager, an assistant manager, and three to four automotive service technicians. Midas
supports the franchise dealer network with 34 district managers and five regional manag-
ers. Each district manager covers approximately 52 franchised Midas shops and assists
franchisees with operations, retail initiatives, training, and monitoring of the franchise
agreement.1 3
Now let’s think about a typical Midas-owned auto service shop to explore the various
cost issues we have studied in a service-industry environment.
Product and Period Costs Midas purchases auto parts and supplies, such as
exhaust pipes, brake pads, oil filters, and engine oil, from vendors. These costs are
stored in inventory as p roduct costs (or i nventoriable costs ) until the time period when
they are consumed in the repair process. At that time, these p roduct costs become part
of cost of goods sold, an expense. All of Midas’ other costs are period costs, and they
are expensed as operating expenses during the period they are incurred. Examples of
13 Recent Midas, Inc. annual reports and the company’s Web site.

================================================================================

60 Chapter 2 Basic Cost Management Concepts and Accounting for Mass Customization Operations
these period costs include employee salaries and wages, utilities, and depreciation on
equipment and facilities.
Variable and Fixed Costs The costs incurred in the Midas service shop that
vary directly with activity are variable costs. For example, the cost of lubricant, engine
oil, and oil filters is a variable cost, because it varies in proportion to the number of lube-
oil-filter (LOF) jobs the shop provides. Thus, a likely cost driver for this cost would be
the number of LOF jobs performed. In contrast, any costs that do not tend to vary with
service activity are f ixed costs. Examples include the Midas shop’s managerial salaries,
depreciation on equipment and facilities, insurance, and property taxes.
Direct and Indirect Costs Consider a typical service and repair job. The cus-
tomer has requested a routine lube-oil-filter job and an exhaust system repair, which
requires a new muffler. The direct costs of this service and repair job (the cost object )
include the parts and supplies used (lubricant, engine oil, oil filter, and a new muf-
fler) and the wages of the automotive service technician for the time spent on this
job. The many indirect costs of this service job include the shop manager’s salary, the
depreciation on the building, and national media advertising purchased nationwide by
Midas, Inc.
Now consider a different cost object—this Midas shop. For this cost object, the shop
manager’s salary is a direct cost of the Midas shop. However, the Midas CEO’s salary is
an indirect cost of this particular shop.
Controllable and Uncontrollable Costs Costs that are c ontrollable by the
manager of this Midas auto shop include local advertising, assuming the shop manager
is responsible for such local ad buys. A cost that is partially controllable by the manager
might include heating costs. Although the manager has little control over electricity or
heating oil prices, the manager can ensure that the shop’s heating system is properly
maintained and the windows and doors have the proper weather stripping. Many of the
shop’s costs are largely u ncontrollable by the shop manager. The depreciation, insurance,
and property taxes on the building, for example, are the result of decisions made higher
up in the Midas organization.
Opportunity, Out-of-Pocket, and Sunk Costs These cost types all are
represented in the Midas auto service business. Suppose the Midas shop manager
decides to shut down one of the service bays on a particular day to inspect and main-
tain the lift and other equipment. Any customer business that is lost that day due to
a shortage of service bays would be an opportunity cost of the shut-down decision.
(Note that such an opportunity cost does not necessarily mean the shut-down decision
was a poor one. The opportunity cost of any lost business could well be exceeded by
the additional operating costs that could be incurred if the service bay was not properly
maintained.) The wages paid to service technicians and utility costs are examples of
out-of-pocket costs. The money spent last year to replace an auto lift is an example of
a sunk cost.
Differential, Marginal, and Average Costs Suppose the Midas shop
owns a small van to make short runs to pick up auto parts needed on short notice.
The van needs to be replaced, and two vehicles are under consideration. The differ-
ence in the cost of these two alternative vehicles is a d ifferential cost of the vehicle
replacement decision. The cost of performing one additional lube-oil-filter (LOF) job
in a given time period is the m arginal cost of that type of service. The total cost of all
LOF jobs in a time period, divided by the number of jobs, is the average cost of an
LOF job.

LO1 Explain what is meant by the word cost. The word cost can have a variety of meanings in dif-
ferent situations. In general, a cost is the sacrifice made, usually measured by the resources given up, to
achieve a particular purpose.
LO2 Distinguish among product costs, period costs, and expenses. A product cost is a cost assigned
to manufactured or purchased goods. Period costs are those associated with the period of time in which
they are incurred. An expense is the cost incurred when an asset is used up for the purpose of generating
revenue.
LO3 Describe the role of costs in published financial statements. The cost of goods sold is an
expense on the income statement. Inventory on the balance sheet is measured at its cost, as are all
assets.
LO4 List five types of manufacturing operations and describe mass customization. The five basic
types of manufacturing operations are job shop, batch, assembly line, mass customization, and continu-
ous flow. In a mass-customization production environment, many standardized components are used to
manufacture customized products to customer order.
LO5 Give examples of three types of manufacturing costs. Manufacturing costs are categorized as
direct-material, direct-labor, and manufacturing-overhead.
LO6 Prepare a schedule of cost of goods manufactured, a schedule of cost of goods sold, and an
income statement for a manufacturer. These accounting schedules, which are illustrated in the chap-
ter, provide information to management about the costs incurred in a production operation.
LO7 Understand the importance of identifying an organization’s cost drivers. A cost driver is any
activity or event that causes costs to be incurred. Understanding the cost drivers in an organization is an
essential component of managing those costs.
LO8 Describe the behavior of variable and fixed costs, in total and on a per-unit basis. As activity
in an organization increases, a variable cost increases proportionately to activity in total, but remains
constant on a per-unit basis. In contrast, as activity in an organization increases, a fixed cost remains
constant in total but decreases on a per-unit basis.
LO9 Distinguish among direct, indirect, controllable, and uncontrollable costs. Direct and indi-
rect costs refer to the ability of the accountant to trace costs to various departments in the organization.
The terms c ontrollable and u ncontrollable are used to describe the extent to which a manager can
influence a cost.
LO10 Define and give examples of an opportunity cost, an out-of-pocket cost, a sunk cost, a
differential cost, a marginal cost, and an average cost. An opportunity cost is the benefit forgone
because the choice of one action precludes another action. An out-of-pocket cost requires the payment
of cash or other assets. Sunk costs are costs incurred in the past that cannot be altered by a current or
future decision. A differential (or incremental) cost refers to the difference in the costs incurred under
two alternative actions. A marginal cost is the cost of producing one additional unit. Finally, the aver-
age cost per unit is the total cost for whatever quantity is produced, divided by the number of units
produced.

were hired on a temporary basis. However, rather than hiring additional flight attendants, the airline used
(LO 1, 3, 5, 9,10)
its current attendants on overtime. Monica Gaines worked the following schedule on August 10. All of
Gaines’s flights on that day were extra flights that the airline would not normally fly.
Regular time: 2 round-trip flights between Topeka and St. Louis (8 hours)
Overtime: 1 one-way flight from Topeka to Kansas City (3 hours)
Gaines earns $12 per hour plus time and a half for overtime. Fringe benefits cost the airline $3 per hour
for any hour worked, regardless of whether it is a regular or overtime hour.
Required:
1. Compute the direct cost of compensating Gaines for her services on the flight from Topeka to Kansas
City.
2. Compute the cost of Gaines’s services that is an indirect cost.
3. How should the cost computed in requirement (2) be treated for cost accounting purposes?
4. Gaines ended her workday on August 10 in Kansas City. However, her next scheduled flight
departed Topeka at 11:00 a.m. on August 11. This required Gaines to “dead-head” back to Topeka
on an early-morning flight. This means she traveled from Kansas City to Topeka as a passenger,
rather than as a working flight attendant. Since the morning flight from Kansas City to Topeka was
full, Gaines displaced a paying customer. The revenue lost by the airline was $82. What type of
cost is the $82? To what flight, if any, is it chargeable? Why?

pare an analysis of the costs that would be saved if the Printer Case Department were closed. Included
in the controller’s list of annual cost savings were the following items:

In a lunchtime conversation with the controller, Cassanitti learned that CompTech was currently
renting space in a warehouse for $39,000. The space is used to store completed printers. If the Printer
Case Department were discontinued, the entire storage operation could be moved into the factory
building and occupy the space vacated by the closed department. Cassanitti also learned that the super-
visor of the Printer Case Department would be retained by CompTech even if the department were
closed. The supervisor would be assigned the job of managing the assembly department, whose super-
visor recently gave notice of his retirement. All of CompTech’s department supervisors earn the same
salary.
Required:
1. You have been hired as a consultant by Cassanitti to advise him in his decision. Write a memo to
Cassanitti commenting on the costs of space and supervisory salaries included in the controller’s
cost analysis. Explain in your memo about the “real” costs of the space occupied by the Printer
Case Department and the supervisor’s salary. What types of costs are these?
2. Independent of your response to requirement (1), suppose that CompTech’s controller had been
approached by his friend Jack Westford, the assistant supervisor of the Printer Case Department.

Spock, and McCoy. Your first day on the job was a busy one, as the following problems were pre-
(LO 7, 8, 10)
sented to you.
1(a). 60,000 copies
Required: Supply the requested comments in each of the following independent situations.
1. FastQ Company, a specialist in printing, has established 500 convenience copying centers through-
out the country. In order to upgrade its services, the company is considering three new models
of laser copying machines for use in producing high-quality copies. These high-quality copies
would be added to the growing list of products offered in the FastQ shops. The selling price to
the customer for each laser copy would be the same, no matter which machine is installed in the
shop. The three models of laser copying machines under consideration are 1024S, a small-volume
model; 1024M, a medium-volume model; and 1024G, a large-volume model. The annual rental
costs and the operating costs vary with the size of each machine. The machine capacities and costs
are as follows:
Copier Model
1024S 1024M 1024G
Annual capacity (copies) .............................................................................. 100,000 350,000 800,000
Costs:
Annual machine rental ............................................................................ $8,000 $11,000 $20,000
Direct material and direct labor ................................................................ .02 .02 .02
Variable overhead costs ........................................................................... .12 .07 .03
a. Calculate the volume level in copies where FastQ Company would be indifferent to acquiring
either the small-volume model laser copier, 1024S, or the medium-volume model laser copier,
1024M.
b. The management of FastQ Company is able to estimate the number of copies to be sold at
each establishment. Present a decision rule that would enable FastQ Company to select the
most profitable machine without having to make a separate cost calculation for each estab-
lishment. (H int: To specify a decision rule, determine the volume at which FastQ would be
indifferent between the small and medium copiers. Then determine the volume at which
FastQ would be indifferent between the medium and large copiers.)
2. Alderon Enterprises is evaluating a special order it has received for a ceramic fixture to be used
in aircraft engines. Alderon has recently been operating at less than full capacity, so the firm’s
management will accept the order if the price offered exceeds the costs that will be incurred in

producing it. You have been asked for advice on how to determine the cost of two raw materials
that would be required to produce the order.
a. The special order will require 800 gallons of endor, a highly perishable material that is pur-
chased as needed. Alderon currently has 1,200 gallons of endor on hand, since the material is
used in virtually all of the company’s products. The last time endor was purchased, Alderon
paid $5.00 per gallon. However, the average price paid for the endor in stock was only $4.75.
The market price for endor is quite volatile, with the current price at $5.50. If the special order
is accepted, Alderon will have to place a new order next week to replace the 800 gallons of
endor used. By then the price is expected to reach $5.75 per gallon.
Using the cost terminology introduced in Chapter 2, comment on each of the cost figures
mentioned in the preceding discussion. What is the real cost of endor if the special order is
produced?
b. The special order also would require 1,500 kilograms of tatooine, a material not normally
required in any of Alderon’s regular products. The company does happen to have 2,000
kilograms of tatooine on hand, since it formerly manufactured a ceramic product that used
the material. Alderon recently received an offer of $14,000 from Solo Industries for its
entire supply of tatooine. However, Solo Industries is not interested in buying any quantity
less than Alderon’s entire 2,000-kilogram stock. Alderon’s management is unenthusiastic
about Solo’s offer, since Alderon paid $20,000 for the tatooine. Moreover, if the tatooine
were purchased at today’s market price, it would cost $11.00 per kilogram. Due to the vola-
tility of the tatooine, Alderon will need to get rid of its entire supply one way or another. If
the material is not used in production or sold, Alderon will have to pay $1,000 for each
500 kilograms that is transported away and disposed of in a hazardous waste disposal site.
Using the cost terminology introduced in Chapter 2, comment on each of the cost figures
mentioned in the preceding discussion. What is the real cost of tatooine to be used in the special
order?
3. A local PBS station has decided to produce a TV series on state-of-the-art manufacturing. The
director of the TV series, Justin Tyme, is currently attempting to analyze some of the projected
costs for the series. Tyme intends to take a TV production crew on location to shoot various
manufacturing scenes as they occur. If the four-week series is shown in the 8:00–9:00 P.M. prime-
time slot, the station will have to cancel a wildlife show that is currently scheduled. Management
projects a 10 percent viewing audience for the wildlife show, and each 1 percent is expected to
bring in donations of $10,000. In contrast, the manufacturing show is expected to be watched by
15 percent of the viewing audience. However, each 1 percent of the viewership will likely generate
only $5,000 in donations. If the wildlife show is canceled, it can be sold to network television for
$25,000.
Using the cost terminology introduced in Chapter 2, comment on each of the financial
amounts mentioned in the scenario above. What are the relative merits of the two shows regarding
the projected revenue to the station?

FOCUS COMPANY >>>
THIS CHAPTER’S FOCUS COMPANY is Adirondack Outfitters, a small
ADIRONDACK
manufacturer of canoes and small boats near Lake Placid, New York.
OUTFITTERS
Adirondack Outfitters uses job-order costing to accumulate the costs of each of its
products. Job-order costing is well suited to companies like Adirondack Outfitters that
manufacture relatively small numbers of distinct products. In a job-order costing system,
direct material, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead are first assigned to each pro-
duction job, such as a set number of canoes of a particular type. Then the cost of
the production job is averaged across the number of units in the job.

In contrast to the manufacturing setting of Adirondack Outfitters, we explore
job-order costing in a service industry environment. Midtown Advertising
Agency is a small firm in Cincinnati, Ohio. The ad agency has two managing partners, six
artistic staff personnel, and an office support staff. Midtown Advertising Agency calculates
predetermined overhead rates based on two cost drivers: partner direct professional labor
and artistic staff direct professional labor. The ad agency’s cost of completing the work for
an advertising contract with Super Scoop Ice Cream Company includes direct material,
direct professional labor for both partner and artistic staff time, and applied overhead.

to value inventory on the balance sheet and to compute cost-of-goods-sold expense on the
income statement. Under generally accepted accounting principles, inventory is valued at
its cost until it is sold. Then the cost of the inventory becomes an expense of the period
in which it is sold.
Use in Managerial Accounting In managerial accounting, product costs are
needed to help managers with planning and to provide them with data for decision mak-
ing. Decisions about product prices, the mix of products to be produced, and the quantity
of output to be manufactured are among those for which product cost information is
needed.
Use in Cost Management It is hard to imagine how management can control or
reduce production costs if management does not have a clear idea of how much it costs to
make its product. Thus, product costs provide crucial data for a variety of cost manage-
ment purposes. Many of the cost management uses of product-costing information will
be covered throughout this book.

Product Costing in Nonmanufacturing Firms
The need for product costs is not limited to manufacturing firms. Merchandising com-
panies include the costs of buying and transporting merchandise in their product costs.
Producers of inventoriable goods, such as mining products, petroleum, and agricultural
products, also record the costs of producing their goods. The role of product costs in
these companies is identical to that in manufacturing firms. For example, the pineapples
grown and sold by D ole are inventoried at their product cost until they are sold. Then the “The closer we get to the

Banks, insurance companies, restaurants, airlines, law firms, hospitals, and city govern-
Qwest
ments all record the costs of producing various services for the purposes of planning, cost
control, and decision making. For example, in making a decision about adding a flight
from Chicago to Houston, U nited Airlines’ management needs to know the cost of flying
the proposed route. Before building a new branch bank, Wachovia ’s management would
want to know the cost of maintaining the branch, as well as the additional revenue to be
generated. A L os Angeles city manager can make a better decision as to whether the city
government should begin a drug counseling program if the cost of providing similar,
existing services is known.
Flow of Costs in Manufacturing Firms
Manufacturing costs consist of direct material, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.
Learning Objective 2
The product-costing systems used by manufacturing firms employ several manufacturing
accounts. As production takes place, all manufacturing costs are added to the Work-in- Diagram and explain the flow of

the account increases the cost-based valuation of the asset represented by the unfinished ing accounts used in product
products. As soon as products are completed, their product costs are transferred from costing.
Work-in-Process Inventory to F inished-Goods Inventory. This is accomplished with a
credit to Work in Process and a debit to Finished Goods. During the time period when
products are sold, the product cost of the inventory sold is removed from Finished Goods
and added to C ost of Goods Sold, which is an expense of the period in which the sale
occurred. A credit to Finished Goods and a debit to Cost of Goods Sold completes this
step. Cost of Goods Sold is closed into the Income Summary account at the end of the
accounting period, along with all other expenses and revenues of the period. Exhibit 3–1
depicts the flow of costs through the manufacturing accounts.

Company’s manufacturing accounts and the effect of the firm’s product costs on its

Types of Product-Costing Systems
The detailed accounting procedures used in product-costing systems depend on the
type of industry involved. Two basic sets of procedures are used: job-order costing and
process costing.
Job-Order Costing Systems
Job-order costing is used by companies with j ob-shop operations or b atch-production
Learning Objective 3
operations. In a job-shop environment, products are manufactured in very low volumes
or one at a time. Examples of a job-shop environment include feature film production, Distinguish between job-order

tions. In a batch-production environment, multiple products are produced in batches of
relatively small quantity. Examples include furniture manufacture, printing, agricultural
equipment, and pleasure boat production.
In j ob-order costing , each distinct batch of production is called a j ob or j ob order .
The cost-accounting procedures are designed to assign costs to each job. Then the costs
assigned to each job are averaged over the units of production in the job to obtain an
average cost per unit. For example, suppose that AccuPrint worked on two printing jobs
during October, and the following costs were incurred.
Job A27 Job B39
(1,000 campaign posters) (100 wedding invitations)
Direct material .............................................................. $100 $ 36
Direct labor ................................................................... 250 40
Manufacturing overhead ................................................ 150 24
Total manufacturing cost ............................................... $500 $100
The cost per campaign poster is $.50 per poster ($500 divided by 1,000 posters), and
the cost per wedding invitation is $1.00 ($100 divided by 100 invitations). “We have to be the best

ries. In a public accounting firm, for example, costs are assigned to audit engagements Micrus
in much the same way they are assigned to a batch of products by a furniture manu- (joint venture of IBM
facturer. Similar procedures are used to assign costs to “cases” in health care facilities, and Cirrus Logic)
to “programs” in government agencies, to research “projects” in universities, and to
“contracts” in consulting and architectural firms.
The cost-accounting system keeps track of production costs as they flow from raw material, through work in process and
finished goods, and into cost of goods sold.

================================================================================

86 Chapter 3 Product Costing and Cost Accumulation in a Batch Production Environment
Process-Costing Systems
Process costing is used by companies that produce large numbers of identical units. Firms
that produce chemicals, microchips, gasoline, beer, fertilizer, textiles, processed food,
and electricity are among those using process costing. In these kinds of firms, there is no
need to trace costs to specific batches of production, because the products in the different
batches are identical. A p rocess-costing system accumulates all the production costs for
a large number of units of output, and then these costs are averaged over all of the units.
For example, suppose the Silicon Valley Company produced 40,000 microchips during
November. The following manufacturing costs were incurred in November.
Direct material ......................................................................... $1,000
Direct labor .............................................................................. 2,000
Manufacturing overhead ........................................................... 3,000
Total manufacturing cost .......................................................... $6,000
The cost per microchip is $.15 (total manufacturing cost of $6,000 ! 40,000 units
produced).
Summary of Alternative Product-Costing Systems
The distinction between job-order and process costing hinges on the type of production
process involved. Job-order costing systems assign costs to distinct production jobs that
are significantly different. Then an average cost is computed for each unit of product in
each job. Process-costing systems average costs over a large number of identical (or very
similar) units of product.
The remainder of this chapter examines the details of job-order costing. The next
chapter covers process costing.
Accumulating Costs in a Job-Order Costing System
To illustrate job-order costing, we will focus on Adirondack Outfitters, Inc. This small
company, nestled in the hills outside Lake Placid, New York, manufactures canoes and
ADIRONDACK
OUTFITTERS small boats.
In a job-order costing system, costs of direct material, direct labor, and manufactur-
ing overhead are assigned to each production job. These costs comprise the i nputs of the
product-costing s ystem. As costs are incurred, they are added to the Work-in-Process
Inventory account in the ledger. To keep track of the manufacturing costs assigned to
each job, a subsidiary ledger is maintained. The subsidiary ledger account assigned to
each job is a document called a job-cost record.
Job-Cost Record
An example of a job-cost record is displayed in Exhibit 3–3 . At this juncture, just focus
on the major sections and headings, which are printed in blue. (For now just ignore the
detailed entries, printed in black, which will be explained in due course.)
This job-cost record is for job F16 consisting of 80 deluxe aluminum fishing boats,
which was produced during November 20x1. Three major sections on the job-cost record
are used to accumulate the costs of direct material, direct labor, and manufacturing over-
head assigned to the job. The other two sections are used to record the total cost and
average unit cost for the job, and to keep track of units shipped to customers. A job-cost
record may be a paper document upon which the entries for direct material, direct labor,
and manufacturing overhead are written. Increasingly, it is a computer file where entries
are made using a computer.

The procedures used to accumulate the costs of direct material, direct labor, and
manufacturing overhead for a job constitute the set of activities performed by the job-
order costing system. These procedures are discussed next.
Direct-Material Costs
As raw materials are needed for the production process, they are transferred from the
warehouse to the production department. To authorize the release of materials, the pro-
duction department supervisor completes a m aterial requisition form and presents it
to the warehouse supervisor. A copy of the material requisition form goes to the cost
accounting department. There it is used as the basis for transferring the cost of the req-
uisitioned material from the Raw-Material Inventory account to the Work-in-Process

Inventory account, and for entering the direct-material cost on the job-cost record for
the production job in process. A document such as the material requisition form, which
is used as the basis for an accounting entry, is called a source document. Exhibit 3–4
shows an example of a material requisition form.
In many production facilities, material requisitions are entered directly into a com-
puter by the production department supervisor. The requisition is automatically trans-
mitted to computers in the warehouse and in the cost accounting department. Such
automation reduces the flow of paperwork, minimizes clerical errors, and speeds up the
product-costing process.
Supply Chain Management An organization’s s upply chain refers to the flow
of all goods, services, and information into and out of the organization. Thus, Adirondack
Outfitters’ supply chain looks like this:
Adirondack
Companies Outfitters’
supplying goods, customers
services, and Adirondack (i.e., retailers
information to Outfitters that sell the
Adirondack company’s
Outfitters canoes and
boats)
A supply chain often includes many companies and other organizations. Supply chain
management means proactively working with some or all of the organizations in a com-
pany’s supply chain to improve service and to manage or reduce costs. For example,
Adirondack Outfitters’ managers might work with the vendor supplying aluminum sheet
metal to improve delivery schedules or reduce material costs. Adirondack Outfitters’
managers also might consult with retailers about more effective displays for the
company’s products or more timely information about the retailers’ restocking needs.
Material-Requirements Planning For products and product components that
are produced routinely, the required materials are known in advance. For these products
and components, material requisitions are based on a b ill of materials that lists all of the
materials needed.
In complex manufacturing operations, in which production takes place in several
stages, m aterial-requirements planning (or M RP ) may be used. MRP is an operations-
management tool that assists managers in scheduling production in each stage of the
manufacturing process. Such careful planning ensures that, at each stage in the produc-
tion process, the required subassemblies, components, or partially processed materials
will be ready for the next stage. MRP systems, which are generally computerized, include
files that list all of the component parts and materials in inventory and all of the parts and
materials needed in each stage of the production process.
Adirondack Outfitters’ operations are too limited to need an MRP system.

Chapter 3 Product Costing and Cost Accumulation in a Batch Production Environment 89
Direct-Labor Costs
The assignment of direct-labor costs to jobs is based on time records filled out by
employees. A time record is a form that records the amount of time an employee
spends on each production job. The time record is the source document used in the cost-
accounting department as the basis for adding direct-labor costs to Work-in-Process
Inventory and to the job-cost records for the various jobs in process. In some facto-
ries, a computerized time-clock system may be used. Employees enter the time they
begin and stop work on each job into the time clock. The time clock is connected to a
computer, which records the time spent on various jobs and transmits the information to
the accounting department.
Exhibit 3–5 displays an example of a time record. As the example shows, most of
the employee’s time was spent working on two different production jobs. In the account-
ing department, the time spent on each job will be multiplied by the employee’s wage
rate, and the cost will be recorded in Work-in-Process Inventory and on the appropriate
job-cost records. The employee also spent one-half hour on shop cleanup duties. This
time will be classified by the accounting department as indirect labor, and its cost will be
included in manufacturing overhead.
Manufacturing-Overhead Costs
It is relatively simple to trace direct-material and direct-labor costs to production jobs,
but manufacturing overhead is not easily traced to jobs. By definition, manufacturing
overhead is a heterogeneous pool of indirect production costs, such as indirect mate-
rial, indirect labor, utility costs, and depreciation. These costs often bear no obvious
relationship to individual jobs or units of product, but they must be incurred for produc-
tion to take place. Therefore, it is necessary to assign manufacturing-overhead costs
to jobs in order to have a complete picture of product costs. This process of assigning
manufacturing-overhead costs to production jobs is called overhead application (or
sometimes o verhead absorption ).
Overhead Application For product-costing information to be useful, it must be
provided to managers on a timely basis. Suppose the cost-accounting department waited
until the end of an accounting period so that the actual costs of manufacturing overhead
could be determined before applying overhead costs to the firm’s products. The result
would be very accurate overhead application. However, the information might be useless
because it was not available to managers for planning, control, and decision making dur-
ing the period.

A ccounting SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
P ractice Supply chain management has become a critically important issue in many companies
and other organizations. Here are several examples of how organizations are managing
Caterpillar, Inc. and
their supply chains to get or provide better service at lower costs.
the U.S. Marine Corps
Caterpillar, Inc.—The Inventory “Bullwhip Effect”
Managing the supply chain is particularly critical for management during an economic
slump and as the economy starts to emerge from a downturn. “ Caterpillar, Inc. recently
told its steel suppliers that it will more than double its purchases of the metal” within a
year, even if there is no increase in sales of Caterpillar’s own products. “In fact, the heavy
equipment manufacturer has been boosting orders to suppliers for everything from big
tires and hydraulic tubes to shatterproof glass.” Why would Caterpillar be making such
a large inventory resupply effort even in the face of nearly flat sales? “Chalk it up to the
‘bullwhip effect,’ which is reverberating” throughout the global economy.
“This phenomenon occurs when companies significantly cut or add inventories.
Economists call it a bullwhip because even small increases in demand can cause a big
snap in the need for parts and materials further down the supply chain. The bullwhip has
broad implications” for the economy as “companies rush to fill orders while also restock-
ing warehouse shelves. It touches everyone from retailers to the industrial companies
that supply” the many resources needed to manufacture more products. “The manner
in which companies, large and small, respond to market shifts determines which ones
emerge first” from an economic downturn and start to grow again. 1
U.S. Marine Corps
“The Marines knew they had problems. When a soldier at Camp Pendleton would put in an
order for a spare part, it took him a week to get it—from the other side of the base. Private
companies, meanwhile, were greasing their supply chains to provide just-in-time delivery,
and the Marines knew they could do better. So the Corps sketched a 10-year tech strat-
egy in logistics, to ensure that 173,000 Marines have what they need when they need it. To
execute, the Corps hired consultants and studied companies like W almart and United Parcel
Service .” The Corps “aims to reduce inventory by half, saving up to $200 million. Taking
a page from U nilever and Swissair, the Corps is developing better relations with suppliers
to make sure they have access to hard-to-get items like tank parts. And with advice from
C aterpillar , the Marines have been upgrading warehouses, adding gadgets like hand-held
wireless scanners for real-time inventory placement and tracking.” 2
direct-labor cost, or machine hours. An estimate is made of (1) the amount of manufac-
turing overhead that will be incurred during a specified period of time and (2) the amount
of the cost driver (or activity base) that will be used or incurred during the same time
period. Then a p redetermined overhead rate is computed as follows:12

For example, Adirondack Outfitters has chosen machine hours as its cost driver (or
activity base). For the year 20x1, the firm estimates that overhead cost will amount to

$360,000 and that total machine hours used will be 40,000 hours. The 40,000 budgeted
machine hours represent the company’s p ractical capacity for production. This means
that 40,000 machine hours are expected to be available for production under normal oper-
ating conditions. Recall from the discussion in Chapter 1 (pp. 18–20) that normal operat-
ing conditions allow for such issues as routine machine maintenance, employee fatigue,
and so forth.
Adirondack Outfitters’ predetermined overhead rate is computed as follows:
P re det e rm in ed # _ _ $ _ 3 _ 6 _ 0 _ , _ 0 _ 0 _ 0 _ _ # $9.00 per machine hour
overhead rate 40,000 hours
In our discussion of the predetermined overhead rate, we have emphasized the
term c ost driver, because increasingly this term is replacing the more traditional term
activity base. Furthermore, we have emphasized that t raditional product-costing sys-
tems tend to rely on a single, volume-based cost driver. We will discuss more elaborate
product-costing systems based on multiple cost drivers later in this chapter. This topic
is examined in even greater detail in Chapter 5.
Applying Overhead Costs The predetermined overhead rate is used to apply
manufacturing overhead costs to production jobs. The quantity of the cost driver (or
activity base) required by a particular job is multiplied by the predetermined overhead
rate to determine the amount of overhead cost applied to the job. For example, suppose
Adirondack Outfitters’ job number D22 requires 30 machine hours. The overhead
applied to the job is computed as follows:
Predetermined overhead rate .............................................. $ 9
Machine hours required by job D22 ..................................... " 30
Overhead applied to job D22 .............................................. $ 270
The $270 of applied overhead will be added to Work-in-Process Inventory and recorded
on the job-cost record for job D22. The accounting entries made to add manufacturing
overhead to Work-in-Process Inventory may be made daily, weekly, or monthly, depend-
ing on the time required to process production jobs. Before the end of an accounting
period, entries should be made to record all manufacturing costs incurred to date in
Work-in-Process Inventory. This is necessary to properly value Work-in-Process Inven-
tory on the balance sheet.
Summary of Event Sequence in Job-Order Costing
The flowchart in Exhibit 3–6 summarizes the sequence of activities performed by the job-
order costing system. The role of the various documents used in job-order costing also is
emphasized in the flowchart.
Illustration of Job-Order Costing
Now let’s examine the accounting entries made by Adirondack Outfitters, Inc. during
Learning Objective 5
November of 20x1. The company worked on two production jobs:
Prepare journal entries to record
Job number C12, 80 deluxe wooden canoes the costs of direct material, direct
Job number F16, 80 deluxe aluminum fishing boats labor, and manufacturing overhead
in a job-order costing system.
The job numbers designate these as the 12th canoe production job and the 16th fishing
boat production job undertaken during the year. The events of November are described

Chapter 3 Product Costing and Cost Accumulation in a Batch Production Environment 93
Purchase of Material
Four thousand square feet of rolled aluminum sheet metal were purchased on account for
$10,000. The purchase is recorded with the following journal entry.
(1) Raw-Material Inventory ....................................................................................... 10,000
Accounts Payable ......................................................................................... 10,000
The postings of this and all subsequent journal entries to the ledger are shown in Exhibit
3–11 , which appears on page 102.
Use of Direct Material
On November 1, the following material requisitions were submitted.
Requisition number 802: 8,000 board feet of lumber, at $2 per board
(for job number C12) foot, for a total of $16,000
Requisition number 803: 7,200 square feet of aluminum sheet metal, at
(for job number F16) $2.50 per square foot, for a total of $18,000
The following journal entry records the release of these raw materials to production.
(2) Work-in-Process Inventory ................................................................................. 34,000
Raw-Material Inventory ................................................................................. 34,000
The associated ledger posting is shown in Exhibit 3–11 . These direct-material costs are
also recorded on the job-cost record for each job. The job-cost record for job number F16
is displayed in Exhibit 3–3 on page 87. Since the job-cost record for job number C12 is
similar, it is not shown.
Use of Indirect Material
On November 15, the following material requisition was submitted.
Requisition number 804: 5 gallons of bonding glue, at $10 per gallon, for a
total cost of $50
Small amounts of bonding glue are used in the production of all classes of boats
manufactured by Adirondack Outfitters. Since the cost incurred is small, no attempt is
made to trace the cost of glue to specific jobs. Instead, glue is considered an indirect
material, and its cost is included in manufacturing overhead. The company accumulates
all manufacturing-overhead costs in the Manufacturing Overhead account. All actual
overhead costs are recorded by debiting this account. The account is debited when indi-
rect materials are requisitioned, when indirect-labor costs are incurred, when utility bills
are paid, when depreciation is recorded on manufacturing equipment, and so forth. The
journal entry made to record the usage of glue is as follows:
(3) Manufacturing Overhead ................................................................................... 50
Manufacturing Supplies Inventory .................................................................. 50
The posting of this journal entry to the ledger is shown in Exhibit 3–11 . No entry is
made on any job-cost record for the usage of glue, since its cost is not traced to individual
production jobs.

Use of Direct Labor
At the end of November, the cost accounting department uses the labor
time records filed during the month to determine the following direct-labor
costs of each job.
Direct labor: job number C12 ........................................................................................... $ 9,000
Direct labor: job number F16 ........................................................................................... 12,000
Total direct labor ............................................................................................................. $21,000
The journal entry made to record these costs is as follows:
(4) Work-in-Process Inventory ................................................. 21,000
Wages Payable ............................................................. 21,000
The associated ledger posting is shown in Exhibit 3–11 . These direct-labor
costs also are recorded on the job-cost record for each job. The job-cost
record for job number F16 is displayed in Exhibit 3–3 on page 87. Only
one direct-labor entry is shown on the job-cost record. In practice, there

Indirect labor: not charged to any particular job, $14,000
This cost comprises the production supervisor’s salary and the wages of various employ-
ees who spent some of their time on maintenance and general cleanup duties during
November. The following journal entry is made to add indirect-labor costs to manufactur-
ing overhead:
(5) Manufacturing Overhead ................................................................................... 14,000
Wages Payable ............................................................................................. 14,000
No entry is made on any job-cost record, since indirect-labor costs are not traceable
to any particular job. In practice, journal entries (4) and (5) are usually combined into one
compound entry as follows:

Manufacturing Overhead ........................................................................................... 14,000
Wages Payable ................................................................................................. 35,000
Incurrence of Manufacturing-Overhead Costs
The following manufacturing-overhead costs were incurred during November:
Manufacturing overhead:
Rent on factory building ..................................................................................... $ 3,000
Depreciation on equipment ................................................................................. 5,000
Utilities (electricity and natural gas) ..................................................................... 4,000

The following compound journal entry is made on November 30 to record
these costs:

The entry is posted in Exhibit 3–11 . No entry is made on any job-cost record, since
manufacturing-overhead costs are not traceable to any particular job.
Application of Manufacturing Overhead
Various manufacturing-overhead costs were incurred during November, and these
costs were accumulated by debiting the Manufacturing Overhead account. However,
no manufacturing-overhead costs have yet been added to Work-in-Process Inventory
or recorded on the job-cost records. The application of overhead to the firm’s products
is based on a predetermined overhead rate. This rate was computed by the accounting
department at the beginning of 20x1 as follows:
P re det e rm in ed # _ B _ u _ d _ g _ e _ te _ d _ _ to _ _ ta _ l _ m __ a _ n _ u _ fa _ c _ t _ u _ ri _ n _ g _ o _ v _ e _ r _ h _ e _ a _ d _ f _ o _ r _ 2 _ 0 _ x _ 1 _
overhead rate Budgeted total machine hours for 20x1
$360,000
# _______ _ # $9.00 per machine hour
40,000
As explained previously, the 40,000 budgeted machine hours represent the company’s
annual practical capacity for production.
Factory machine-usage records indicate the following actual usage of machine hours
during November:
Machine hours used: job number C12 ................................................................... 1,200 hours
Machine hours used: job number F16 ................................................................... 2,000 hours
Total machine hours ............................................................................................. 3,200 hours
The total manufacturing overhead applied to Work-in-Process Inventory during
November is calculated as follows:
Machine Predetermined Manufacturing
Hours Overhead Rate Overhead Applied
Job number C12 .............................................. 1,200 " $9.00 # $10,800
Job number F16 .............................................. 2,000 " $9.00 # 18,000
Total manufacturing overhead applied .................................................................................................. $28,800
The following journal entry is made to add a pplied manufacturing overhea d to
Work-in-Process Inventory.

Summary of Overhead Accounting
As the following time line shows, three concepts are used in accounting for overhead.
Overhead is b udgeted at the beginning of the accounting period, it is applied during the
period, and a ctual overhead is measured at the e nd of the period.

Chrysler head rate will generally prove to be incorrect to some degree. Consequently, there will usu-
ally be a nonzero balance left in the Manufacturing Overhead account at the end of the year.
This balance is usually relatively small, and its disposition is covered later in this illustration.
Selling and Administrative Costs
During November, Adirondack Outfitters incurred selling and administrative costs as follows:
Rental of sales and administrative offices ................................................. $ 1,500
Salaries of sales personnel ...................................................................... 4,000
Salaries of management .......................................................................... 8,000
Advertising ............................................................................................. 1,000
Office supplies used ................................................................................ 300
Total ....................................................................................................... $14,800
Since these are not manufacturing costs, they are not added to Work-in-Process
Inventory. Selling and administrative costs are period costs, not product costs.

Prepaid Rent ................................................................................................ 1,500
Office Supplies Inventory ............................................................................... 300
The entry is posted in Exhibit 3–11 .
Completion of a Production Job
Job number F16 was completed during November, whereas job number C12 remained in
process. As the job-cost record in Exhibit 3–3 (page 87) indicates, the total cost of job
number F16 was $48,000. The following journal entry records the transfer of these job
costs from Work-in-Process Inventory to Finished-Goods Inventory.
(9) Finished-Goods Inventory .................................................................................. 48,000
Work-in-Process Inventory ............................................................................ 48,000
The entry is posted in Exhibit 3–11 .
Sale of Goods
Sixty deluxe aluminum fishing boats manufactured in job number F16 were sold for $900
each during November. The cost of each unit sold was $600, as shown on the job-cost
record in Exhibit 3–3 (page 87). The following journal entries are made.
(10) Accounts Receivable ....................................................................................... 54,000
Sales Revenue ............................................................................................. 54,000
(11) Cost of Goods Sold .......................................................................................... 36,000
Finished-Goods Inventory .............................................................................. 36,000
These entries are posted in Exhibit 3–11 .
The remainder of the manufacturing costs for job number F16 remain in Finished-
Goods Inventory until some subsequent accounting period when the units are sold.
Therefore, the cost balance for job number F16 remaining in inventory is $12,000
(20 units remaining times $600 per unit). This balance is shown on the job-cost record in
Exhibit 3–3 (page 87).
Underapplied and Overapplied Overhead
During November, Adirondack Outfitters incurred total actual manufacturing-overhead
costs of $29,050, but only $28,800 of overhead was applied to Work-in-Process Inven-
tory. The amount by which actual overhead exceeds applied overhead, called u nder-
applied overhead, is calculated below.
Actual manufacturing overhead* ..................................................................................................................... $ 29,050
Applied manufacturing overhead† .................................................................................................................... 28,800
Underapplied overhead ................................................................................................................................... $ 250
*Sum of debit entries in the Manufacturing-Overhead account: $50 $ $14,000 $ $15,000 # $29,050. See Exhibit 3–11.
†Applied overhead: $9.00 per machine hour " 3,200 machine hours.
If actual overhead had been less than applied overhead, the difference would have been
called o verapplied overhead. Underapplied or overapplied overhead is caused by errors

in the estimates of overhead and activity used to compute the predetermined overhead
rate. In this illustration, Adirondack Outfitters’ predetermined rate was underestimated
by a small amount.
Disposition of Underapplied or Overapplied Overhead At the end of
an accounting period, the managerial accountant has two alternatives for the disposition
of underapplied or overapplied overhead. Under the most common alternative, the under-
applied or overapplied overhead is closed into Cost of Goods Sold. This is the method
used by Adirondack Outfitters, and the required journal entry is shown below.
(12) Cost of Goods Sold .......................................................................................... 250
Manufacturing Overhead ............................................................................... 250
This entry, which is posted in Exhibit 3–11 , brings the balance in the Manufactur-
ing Overhead account to zero. The account is then clear to accumulate manufacturing-
overhead costs incurred in the next accounting period. Journal entry (12) has the effect of
increasing cost-of-goods-sold expense. This reflects the fact that the cost of the units sold
had been underestimated due to the slightly underestimated predetermined overhead rate.
Most companies use this approach because it is simple and the amount of underapplied
or overapplied overhead is usually small. Moreover, most firms wait until the end of the
year to close underapplied or overapplied overhead into Cost of Goods Sold, rather than
making the entry monthly as in this illustration.
Proration of Underapplied or Overapplied Overhead Some compa-
nies use a more accurate procedure to dispose of underapplied or overapplied overhead.
This approach recognizes that underestimation or overestimation of the predetermined
overhead rate affects not only Cost of Goods Sold, but also Work-in-Process Inventory
and Finished-Goods Inventory. As the following diagram shows, applied overhead passes
through all three of these accounts. Therefore, all three accounts are affected by any in-
accuracy in the predetermined overhead rate.
Work-In-Process Finished-Goods Cost of Goods

When underapplied or overapplied overhead is allocated among the three accounts
shown above, the process is called proration. The amount of the current period’s
applied overhead remaining in each account is the basis for the proration procedure. In
the Adirondack Outfitters illustration, the amounts of applied overhead remaining in the
three accounts on November 30 are determined as follows:

*Rounded
Using the percentages calculated above, the proration of Adirondack Outfitters’
underapplied overhead is determined as follows:
Underapplied Amount Added
Account Overhead ! Percentage $ to Account
Work in Process ....................................................... $250 " 37.5% # $ 93.75
Finished Goods ........................................................ 250 " 15.6% # 39.00
Cost of Goods Sold ................................................... 250 " 46.9% # 117.25
Total underapplied overhead prorated ........................ $250.00
If Adirondack Outfitters had chosen to prorate underapplied overhead, the following
journal entry would have been made.
Work-in-Process Inventory ......................................................................................... 93.75
Finished-Goods Inventory .......................................................................................... 39.00
Cost of Goods Sold .................................................................................................... 117.25
Manufacturing Overhead ................................................................................... 250.00
Since this is not the method used by Adirondack Outfitters in our continuing illustration,
this entry is not posted to the ledger in Exhibit 3–11 .
Proration of underapplied an overapplied overhead is used by a small number of
firms that are required to do so under the rules specified by the C ost Accounting Stan-
dards Board (CASB). This federal agency was chartered by Congress in 1970 to develop
cost-accounting standards for large government contractors. The agency was discontin-
ued by Congress in 1980, but it was re-created in 1988. The standards set forth by the
agency apply to significant government contracts and have the force of federal law.

A few companies use a ctual costing, a system in which direct material and direct
labor are added to work in process at their actual amounts, and actual overhead is allo-
cated to work in process using an actual overhead rate computed at the end of each
accounting period. Note that even though an actual overhead rate is used, the amount of
overhead assigned to each production job is still an allocated amount. Overhead costs,
which are by definition indirect costs, cannot be traced easily to individual production

jobs. A significant drawback of actual costing is that product-cost information is not
available until the end of the accounting period, when the actual overhead rate is com-
puted. Actual and normal costing may be summarized as follows:

Choosing the Cost Driver for Overhead Application
Manufacturing overhead includes various indirect manufacturing costs that vary greatly
in their relationship to the production process. If a single, volume-based cost driver (or
activity base) is used in calculating the predetermined overhead rate, it should be some
productive input that is common across all of the firm’s products. If, for example, all of
the firm’s products require direct labor, but only some products require machine time,
direct-labor hours would be a preferable activity base. If machine time were used as the
base, products not requiring machine time would not be assigned any overhead cost.
In selecting a volume-based cost driver (or activity base), the goal is to choose an
input that varies in a pattern that is most similar to the pattern with which overhead costs
vary. Products that indirectly cause large amounts of overhead costs also should require
large amounts of the cost driver, and vice versa. During periods when the cost driver is at “As we continue to
a low level, the overhead costs incurred should be low. Thus, there should be a correlation automate our production
between the incurrence of overhead costs and use of the cost driver. processes, direct labor is
becoming less and less
Limitation of Direct Labor as a Cost Driver In traditional product-costing appropriate as a basis for
systems, the most common volume-based cost drivers are direct-labor hours and direct- the application of manufac-

cation base. Many production processes are becoming increasingly automated, through Chrysler
the use of robotics and computer-integrated manufacturing systems. Increased automa-
tion brings two results. First, manufacturing-overhead costs represent a larger proportion
of total production costs. Second, direct labor decreases in importance as a factor of
production. As direct labor declines in importance as a productive input, it becomes less
appropriate as a cost driver. For this reason, some firms have switched to machine hours,
process time, or throughput time as cost drivers that better reflect the pattern of over-
head cost incurrence. T hroughput time (or cycle time ) is the average amount of time
required to convert raw materials into finished goods ready to be shipped to customers.
Throughput time includes the time required for material handling, production processing,
inspection, and packaging.
Departmental Overhead Rates
In the Adirondack Outfitters illustration presented earlier in this chapter, all of the firm’s
manufacturing overhead was combined into a single cost pool. Then the overhead was
applied to products using a single predetermined overhead rate based on machine hours.

104 Chapter 3 Product Costing and Cost Accumulation in a Batch Production Environment
Since only one overhead rate is used in Adirondack Outfitters’ entire factory, it is known
as a plantwide overhead rate. In some production processes, the relationship between
overhead costs and the firm’s products differs substantially across production depart-
ments. In such cases, the firm may use d epartmental overhead rates, which differ across
production departments. This usually results in a more accurate assignment of overhead
costs to the firm’s products. An even more accurate assignment of overhead costs can be
achieved with a ctivity-based costing (ABC), which is covered extensively in Chapter 5.
Two-Stage Cost Allocation
When a company uses departmental overhead rates, the assignment of manufacturing-
Learning Objective 7
overhead costs to production jobs is accomplished in two stages, comprising what is
Describe the two-stage called t wo-stage cost allocation. In the first stage, all manufacturing-overhead costs are

stage process in more detail.
Stage One In the first stage, all manufacturing-overhead costs are assigned to the
firm’s production departments. However, stage one often involves two different types
of allocation processes. First, all manufacturing-overhead costs are assigned to d epart-
mental overhead centers. This step is called c ost distribution (or sometimes c ost
allocation ) . For example, the costs of heating a factory with natural gas would be dis-
tributed among all of the departments in the factory, possibly in proportion to the cubic
feet of space in each department. In the cost distribution step, manufacturing-overhead
costs are assigned to b oth production departments and service departments. S ervice
departments, such as equipment-maintenance and material-handling departments, are
departments that do not work directly on the firm’s products but are necessary for pro-
duction to take place.
Second, all service department costs are reassigned to the production departments
“We’re going to need much through a process called service department cost allocation. In this step, an attempt
more general knowledge of is made to allocate service department costs on the basis of the relative proportion of
how the business works.” each service department’s output that is used by the various production departments. For
(3g) example, production departments with more equipment would be allocated a larger share
Boeing of the maintenance department’s costs.
At the conclusion of stage one, all manufacturing-overhead costs have been assigned
to the production departments.
Stage Two In the second stage, all of the manufacturing-overhead costs accumu-
lated in each production department are assigned to the production jobs on which the
department has worked. This process is called overhead application (or sometimes over-
head absorption). In stage two, each production department has its own predetermined
overhead rate. These rates often are based on different cost drivers.
The two-stage process of assigning overhead costs to production jobs is portrayed
in Exhibit 3–12 . Notice the roles of cost distribution, service department cost allocation,
and overhead application in the exhibit. The techniques of overhead distribution and ser-
vice department cost allocation will be covered later in the text. In this chapter, we are
focusing primarily on the process of overhead application. 3
3 One might legitimately ask why this is called two-stage cost allocation when there are three types of allocation
involved. The term two-stage allocation is entrenched in the literature and in practice. It stems from the fact that
there are two cost objects, or entities, to which costs are assigned: production d epartments in stage one and produc-
tion jobs in stage two.

turing organizations. However, rather than referring to production “jobs,” such orga-

agencies typically refer to “programs” or “missions.” The need for cost accumulation
exists in these and similar organizations for the same reasons found in manufacturing
firms. For example, a mission to launch a commercial satellite by N ASA or A rianespace
is assigned a cost for the purposes of planning, cost control, and pricing of the launch
service.

106 Chapter 3 Product Costing and Cost Accumulation in a Batch Production Environment
To illustrate the cost-accumulation system used in a service industry firm, let’s turn
our attention to Midtown Advertising Agency in Cincinnati, Ohio. This small ad agency
has two managing partners who pay themselves annual salaries of $100,000 each,
and an artistic staff of six people who each earn $50,000 per year. Fringe benefits for
these professionals average 40 percent of their compensation. So Midtown Advertising
Agency’s direct professional labor budget is as follows:
Partner salaries .......................................................................... $200,000
Partner benefits (40%) ............................................................... 80,000
Total partner compensation ......................................................... $280,000
Artistic staff salaries ................................................................... $300,000
Artistic staff benefits (40%) ......................................................... 120,000
Total artistic staff compensation .................................................. $420,000
The ad agency’s annual overhead budget, which totals $756,000, appears in Exhibit 3–13 .
The overhead budget includes the costs of the support staff, artistic and photographic

Overhead is assigned to each ad contract at the rate of 90 percent of partner direct
professional labor plus 120 percent of artistic staff direct professional labor. During May,
Midtown Advertising Agency completed an advertising project for Super Scoop Ice
Cream Company . The contract required $1,800 in direct material, $1,200 of partner direct
professional labor, and $2,000 of artistic staff direct professional labor. The total cost of
the contract is computed as follows:
Contract MJH0207: Advertising Program

Artistic staff support ($2,000 " 120%) ............................................................. 2,400
Total cost ............................................................................................................. $8,480
The total contract cost of $8,480 includes actual direct material and direct professional
labor costs, and applied overhead based on the predetermined overhead rates for partner
support costs and artistic staff support costs. The contract cost can be used by the firm
in controlling costs, for planning cash flows and operations, and as one informational
input in its contract-pricing decisions. In addition to the contract cost, the firm also
should consider the demand for its advertising services and the prices charged by its
competitors.
The discussion above provides only a brief overview of cost-accumulation
procedures in service industry and nonprofit organizations. The main point is that
job-order costing systems are used in a wide variety of organizations, and these sys-
tems provide important information to managers for planning, decision making, and
control.
Changing Technology in Manufacturing Operations
The technology of manufacturing is changing rapidly. These technological changes often
affect the managerial accounting procedures used to collect data and transmit information
to the intended users. Three such technological changes are electronic data interchange
(or EDI), Extensible Markup Language (or XML), and the use of bar codes.
EDI and XML
Electronic data interchange (or EDI ) is the direct exchange of data between organiza-
tions via a computer-to-computer interface. EDI is used to transmit such documents
as purchase orders, shipping notices, receiving notices, invoices, and a host of other
hiL10912_ch03_080-133.indd 107 7/2/10 2:55 PM
================================================================================
PAGE 143
================================================================================

108 Chapter 3 Product Costing and Cost Accumulation in a Batch Production Environment
production-related data. This eliminates the need for paperwork, speeding up the flow
of information and substantially reducing errors. EDI is now in widespread use. For
example, W almart places most of its merchandise orders to its suppliers using this infor-
mation technology.
A recently developed alternative to EDI is Extensible Markup Language (or XML ),
which is Web-based and less expensive to implement than EDI. Its purpose is to allow
users to share structured data (e.g., product order lists or price data) via the Internet.
XML allows its users to define “tags,” which the computer then interprets as a particu-
lar type of information. For example, a tag might indicate a product’s in-stock date
or price. See www.XML.com for a primer on this rapidly growing Web-based data-
sharing tool.
Use of Bar Codes
We all have seen bar codes used to record inventory and sales information in retail

110 Chapter 3 Product Costing and Cost Accumulation in a Batch Production Environment
Chapter Summary
LO1 Discuss the role of product and service costing in manufacturing and nonmanufacturing firms.
Product costing is the process of accumulating the costs of a production process and assigning them to the
firm’s products. Product costs are needed for three major purposes: (1) to value inventory and cost of goods
sold in financial accounting; (2) to provide managerial accounting information to managers for planning,
cost control, and decision making; and (3) to provide cost data to various organizations outside the firm.
LO2 Diagram and explain the flow of costs through the manufacturing accounts used in product
costing. The costs of direct material, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead are first entered into the
Work-in-Process Inventory account. When goods are completed, the accumulated manufacturing costs
are transferred from Work-in-Process Inventory to Finished-Goods Inventory. Finally, these product
costs are transferred from Finished-Goods Inventory to Cost of Goods Sold when sales occur.
LO3 Distinguish between job-order costing and process costing. Job-order costing is used by firms
that engage in either job-shop or batch-production operations. Such firms produce relatively small num-
bers of dissimilar products. Process costing is used by companies that produce relatively large numbers
of nearly identical products.
LO4 Compute a predetermined overhead rate and explain its use in job-order costing for job-
shop and batch-production environments. Overhead is applied to production jobs using a predeter-
mined overhead rate, which is based on estimates of manufacturing overhead (in the numerator) and the
level of some cost driver or activity base (in the denominator).
LO5 Prepare journal entries to record the costs of direct material, direct labor, and manufactur-
ing overhead in a job-order costing system. Journal entries, as illustrated in the chapter, are used to
track the flow of manufacturing costs through the various accounts, such as Raw-Material Inventory,
Work-in-Process Inventory, Finished-Goods Inventory, and Cost of Goods Sold.
LO6 Prepare a schedule of cost of goods manufactured, a schedule of cost of goods sold, and an
income statement for a manufacturer. These accounting schedules, which are illustrated in the chap-
ter, provide information to management about the costs incurred in a production operation.
LO7 Describe the two-stage allocation process used to assign manufacturing overhead costs to pro-
duction jobs. In stage one, cost distribution and service-department cost allocation are used to assign all
manufacturing overhead costs to production departments. In stage two, cost application is used to assign
overhead costs from production departments to production jobs using a predetermined overhead rate.
LO8 Describe the process of project costing used in service industry firms and nonprofit organi-
zations. Job-order costing methods are used in a variety of service industry firms and nonprofit orga-
nizations. Accumulating costs of projects, contracts, cases, programs, or missions provides important
information to managers in such organizations as hospitals, law firms, and government agencies.
Review Problem on Job-Order Costing
Piedmont Paint Company uses a job-order costing system, and the company had two jobs in process at
the beginning of the current year. Job JY65 currently has a cost of $134,400 assigned to it, and job DC66
currently has a cost of $85,600 assigned to it. The following additional information is available.
• The company applies manufacturing overhead on the basis of machine hours. Budgeted overhead and
machine activity (based on practical capacity) for the year were $1,344,000 and 16,000 hours, respectively.
• The company worked on four jobs during the first quarter. Direct materials used, direct labor
incurred, and machine hours consumed were as follows:
Job No. Direct Material Direct Labor Machine Hours
JY65 .................................... $33,600 ............................... $ 56,000 .......................... 1,200
DC66 ................................... — ............................... 35,200 .......................... 700
SG78 ................................... 70,400 ............................... 104,000 .......................... 2,000

Marc Jackson has recently been hired as a cost accountant by Offset Press Company , a privately held
Ethical Issues; Underap-
company that produces a line of offset printing presses and lithograph machines. During his first few
plication of Manufacturing
months on the job, Jackson discovered that Offset has been underapplying factory overhead to the
Overhead
Work-in-Process Inventory account, while overstating expenses through the General and Administrative
(LO 1, 2, 4, 6)
Expense account. This practice has been going on since the start of the company, which is in its sixth
year of operation. The effect in each year has been favorable, having a material impact on the company’s
tax position. No internal audit function exists at Offset, and the external auditors have not yet discovered
the underapplied factory overhead.

Prior to the sixth-year audit, Jackson had pointed out the practice and its effect to Mary Brown, the
corporate controller, and had asked her to let him make the necessary adjustments. Brown directed him
not to make the adjustments, but to wait until the external auditors had completed their work and see
what they uncovered.
The sixth-year audit has now been completed, and the external auditors have once again failed to
discover the underapplication of factory overhead. Jackson again asked Brown if he could make the
required adjustments and was again told not to make them. Jackson, however, believes that the adjust-
ments should be made and that the external auditors should be informed of the situation.
Since there are no established policies at Offset Press Company for resolving ethical conflicts,
Jackson is considering one of the following three alternative courses of action:
• Follow Brown’s directive and do nothing further.
• Attempt to convince Brown to make the proper adjustments and to advise the external auditors of
her actions.
• Tell the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors about the problem and give them the appropri-
ate accounting data.
Required:
1. For each of the three alternative courses of action that Jackson is considering, explain whether or
not the action is appropriate.
2. Independent of your answer to requirement (1), assume that Jackson again approaches Brown to
make the necessary adjustments and is unsuccessful. Describe the steps that Jackson should take in
proceeding to resolve this situation.

The firm’s job-order costing system uses direct-labor hours (measured at practical capacity) as the cost
driver for overhead application. In December of the preceding year, Shar had prepared the following
budget for direct-labor and manufacturing-overhead costs for the current year. The plant is theoretically
capable of operating at 150,000 direct-labor hours per year. However, Shar estimates that the practical
capacity is 120,000 hours in a typical year.

direct-labor hour
Each model of fax machine requires 20 hours of direct labor. The basic system requires 5 hours in
department A and 15 hours in department B. The advanced system requires 15 hours in department A and
5 hours in department B. The overhead costs budgeted in these two production departments are as follows:
Department A Department B
Variable cost ................................................................................ $16 per direct-labor hour $4 per direct-labor hour
Fixed cost .................................................................................... $200,000 $200,000
The firm’s management expects to operate at a level of 20,000 direct-labor hours in each pro-
duction department during the current year. (This estimate is based on the practical capacity of each
department.)
Required:
1. Show how the company’s predetermined overhead rate was determined.
2. If the firm prices each model of fax machines at 10 percent over its cost, what will be the price of
each model?
3. Suppose the company were to use departmental predetermined overhead rates. Calculate the rate
for each of the two production departments.
4. Compute the product cost of each model using the departmental overhead rates calculated in
requirement (3).
5. Compute the price to be charged for each model, assuming the company continues to price each
product at 10 percent above cost. Use the revised product costs calculated in requirement (4).
6. Write a memo to the president of TeleTech Corporation making a recommendation as to whether
the firm should use a plantwide overhead rate or departmental rates. Consider the potential impli-
cations of the overhead rates and the firm’s pricing policy. How might these considerations affect
the firm’s ability to compete in the marketplace?

FOCUS COMPANY > >>
THIS CHAPTER’S FOCUS COMPANY is the M VP Sports Equipment
Company. The company’s Wisconsin Division manufactures baseball gloves MVP
Sports Equipment Company
in its Milwaukee plant. MVP’s Wisconsin Division uses a product-costing
method called process costing. Under process costing, direct material and conversion costs
(direct labor and manufacturing overhead) are first assigned to each of the processes (or
departments) used in the manufacturing opera-
tion. Then, the costs of each process (or depart-
ment) are assigned to the units worked on in the
department. Process costing is used only
by manufacturing companies
that produce relatively large
numbers of similar products.

IN CONTRAST >>>
In contrast to the process-costing system used in MVP’s Wisconsin Division,
we explore a different product-costing system in the company’s Minnesota MVP
Sports Equipment Company
Division. This MVP division manufactures two types of basketballs in its
Minneapolis plant. The professional basketballs are covered with genuine leather, whereas
the scholastic basketballs are covered with imitation leather. Except for the different exte-
rior material, though, each basketball requires the same production steps. MVP’s Minnesota
Division uses a product-costing system called operation costing, which is well suited to its
production environment. Operation costing is used only by manufacturing companies.

AFTER COMPLETING THIS CHAPTER, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
1 List and explain the similarities and important differences between job-order and
process costing.
2 Prepare journal entries to record the flow of costs in a process-costing system
with sequential production departments.
3 Prepare a table of equivalent units under weighted-average process costing.
4 Compute the cost per equivalent unit under the weighted-average method of
process costing.
5 Analyze the total production costs for a department under the weighted-average
method of process costing.
6 Prepare a departmental production report under weighted-average process
costing.
7 Describe how an operation costing system accumulates and assigns the costs of
direct-material and conversion activity in a batch manufacturing process.
We have seen that a product-costing system performs two primary functions:
1. Accumulating production costs.
2. Assigning those production costs to the firm’s products.
Product costs are needed for the purposes of planning, cost management, decision mak-
ing, and reporting to various outside organizations, such as governmental regulatory
agencies.
Job-order costing was described in Chapter 3. This type of product-costing system
is used when relatively small numbers of products are produced in distinct batches or
job orders and these products differ significantly from each other. This chapter cov-
ers p rocess-costing systems. Process costing is used in r epetitive production environ-
ments, where large numbers of identical or very similar products are manufactured in a
continuous flow. Industries using process costing include paper, petroleum, chemicals,
textiles, food processing, lumber, and electronics.
Comparison of Job-Order Costing and Process Costing
In many ways, job-order costing and process costing are similar. Both product-costing
Learning Objective 1
systems have the same ultimate purpose—assignment of production costs to units of out-
List and explain the similari- put. Moreover, the flow of costs through the manufacturing accounts is the same in the

between job-order and process
costing.
Flow of Costs
Exhibit 4–1 displays the flow of costs in two process-costing situations: one with a sin-
gle production department and one with two production departments used in sequence.
The same accounts are used in this process-costing illustration as were used in job-order

costing in the preceding chapter. As the illustration shows, direct-material, direct-labor,
and manufacturing-overhead costs are added to a Work-in-Process Inventory account. As
goods are finished, costs are transferred to Finished-Goods Inventory. During the period
when goods are sold, the product costs are transferred to Cost of Goods Sold. In the
two-department case, when goods are finished in the first production department, costs
accumulated in the Work-in-Process Inventory account for production department A are
transferred to the Work-in-Process Inventory account for production department B.
The journal entries for the case of two sequential production departments, as illus-
trated in Exhibit 4–1 , are as follows. (The numbers used in the journal entries are assumed
for the purpose of showing the form of the entries.)
1. As direct material and direct labor are used in production department A, these
costs are added to the Work-in-Process Inventory account for department A.
Overhead is applied using a predetermined overhead rate. The predetermined
overhead rate is computed in the same way in job-order and process costing.

ent stages of completion with respect to material and conversion activity. For example,
the in-process units may be 75 percent complete with respect to conversion, but they may
already include all of their direct materials. This situation is portrayed in E xhibit 4–3 .
Equivalent Units
The graphical illustration in Exhibit 4–3 supposes there are 1,000 physical units in process
at the end of an accounting period. Each of the physical units is 75 percent complete with
respect to conversion (direct labor and manufacturing overhead). How much conversion
activity has been applied to these partially completed units? Conversion activity occurs
uniformly throughout the production process. Therefore, the amount of conversion activity

The term e quivalent units is used in process costing to refer to the amount of manufac-
turing activity that has been applied to a batch of physical units. The 1,000 physical units
in process represent 7 50 equivalent units of conversion activity.
The term e quivalent units also is used to measure the amount of direct materials rep-
resented by the partially completed goods. Since direct materials are incorporated at the
beginning of the production process, the 1,000 physical units represent 1 ,000 equivalent
units of direct material (1,000 physical units " 100% complete with respect to direct
materials).
The most important feature of process costing is that the costs of direct material
and conversion are assigned to equivalent units rather than to physical units. Refer again “Operations [managers]

100% complete with
respect to direct material.
This is a highly simplified example because there is no work-in-process inventory at
the beginning of the accounting period and no goods were completed during the period.
Nevertheless, it illustrates the important concept that under process costing, costs are
assigned to equivalent units rather than physical units.
Illustration of Process Costing
T he key document in a typical process-costing system is the departmental production
report, prepared for each production department at the end of every accounting period.
This report replaces the job-cost record, which is used to accumulate costs by job in a
job-order costing system. The departmental production report summarizes the flow of
production quantities through the department, and it shows the amount of production cost
transferred out of the department’s Work-in-Process Inventory account during the period.
The following four steps are used in preparing a departmental production report.
1. Analysis of physical flow of units.
2. Calculation of equivalent units (for direct material and conversion activity).
Process costing is used in the wine industry. First, raw material (in this case, grapes) is harvested and entered into
production. Then conversion costs are incurred in the production process. At the end of the accounting period, partially
completed units of wine remain in process as the wine ages.

3. Computation of unit costs (i.e., the cost per equivalent unit for direct material
and conversion).
4. Analysis of total costs (determine the cost to be removed from work in process
and transferred either to the next production department or to finished goods).
The method of process costing that we will focus on in this chapter is called the
weighted-average method. This method is almost always used in practice by companies
using process costing. There is another process-costing method called the first-in, first-
out, or F IFO, method. This method is covered in some cost accounting courses, but it is
rarely used in practice.1

A ccounting NEW YORK WINE INDUSTRY
P ractice The New York State wine industry, the second largest in the United States after California,
contributes $3.76 billion to the state’s economy annually. The Empire State’s 30 thou-
sand acres of vineyards and 212 wineries produce over 200 million bottles of wine each
year. New York wineries in the Finger Lakes region, in the Hudson Valley, along the Lake
Erie shoreline, in the Niagara escarpment area, and on Long Island constitute the fastest-
growing segment of New York’s two largest industries: agriculture and tourism.
Wine production provides an excellent example of process costing. The processes
used in a typical Finger Lakes area vineyard are as follows: 2
• T rimming: At the end of a growing season, the vines are trimmed, which helps
prepare them for the next harvest.
• T ying: The vines are tied onto wires to help protect them from the weather. (This
also occurs at the end of the season.)
• H illing: Dirt is piled up around the roots to further protect them.
• C onditioning: In the spring, dirt is leveled back from the roots.
• U ntying: The vines are untied from the wires to allow them freedom to grow dur-
ing the spring and summer months.
• Chemical spraying: The vines are sprayed in the spring to protect them from
disease and insects.
• H arvesting: The highest-quality grapes are picked by hand to minimize damage.
• S temming and crushing: Batches of grapes are loaded into a machine, which
gently removes the stems and mildly crushes them.
• P ressing: After removal from the stemmer/crusher, the juice runs freely from the
grapes.
• F iltering: The grapes are crushed mechanically to render more juice from them.
• F ermentation: This process varies, depending on the type of wine. For example,
riesling grape juice is placed in stainless-steel tanks for fermentation. Chardonnay
grape juice undergoes a two-stage fermentation process in oak barrels.
• A ging: Again, this process varies. Riesling wines are aged in the stainless-steel
tanks for approximately a year. Chardonnays are aged in the oak barrels for
about two years.
• B ottling: A machine bottles the wine and corks the bottles.
• Labeling: Each bottle is labeled with the name of the vintner, vintage, and
variety.
• P acking: The bottles are packed in 12-bottle cases.
• C ase labeling: The cases are stamped with the same information as is on the
bottles.
• S hipping: The wine is shipped to wine distributors and retailers.
incurred during February. These costs were assigned to the units remaining in process
at the end of February. 2

Inventory account has the following balance on March 1:

The following journal entry is made during March to add the costs of direct material,
direct labor, and manufacturing overhead to Work-in-Process Inventory.

Weighted-Average Method of Process Costing
We now present the four steps used to prepare a departmental production report using
weighted-average process costing.
Step 1: Analysis of Physical Flow of Units The first step is to prepare
a table summarizing the physical flow of production units during March. The table is
shown in Exhibit 4–5 and reflects the following inventory formula.

Step 2: Calculation of Equivalent Units The second step in the process-
Learning Objective 3
costing procedure is to calculate the equivalent units of direct material and conversion
activity. A table of equivalent units, displayed in Exhibit 4–6 , is based on the table of Prepare a table of equivalent
physical flows prepared in step 1 (E xhibit 4–5) . The 40,000 physical units that were units under weighted-average
completed and transferred out of the Cutting Department were 100 percent complete. process costing.
Thus, they represent 40,000 equivalent units for both direct material and conversion. The
10,000 units in the ending work-in-process inventory are complete with respect to direct
material, and they represent 10,000 equivalent units of direct material. However, they
are only 50 percent complete with respect to conversion. Therefore, the ending work-in-
process inventory represents 5,000 equivalent units of conversion activity (10,000 physical
units " 50% complete).
As Exhibit 4–6 indicates, the total number of equivalent units is calculated:

Total equivalent units ......................................................... 50,000 45,000
Note that the total equivalent units of activity, for both direct material and conversion,
exceeds the activity accomplished in the current period alone. Since only 30,000 physi-
cal product units were started during March and direct material is added at the beginning
of the process, only 30,000 equivalent units of direct material were actually placed into
production during March. However, the total number of equivalent units of direct mate-
rial used for weighted-average process costing is 50,000 (see Exhibit 4–6 ). The other
20,000 equivalent units of direct material were actually entered into production during
the preceding month. T his is the key feature of the weighted-average method. The number
of equivalent units of activity is calculated without making a distinction as to whether the
activity occurred in the current accounting period or the preceding period.

The point of this demonstration is that under weighted-average process costing,
unit-cost figures are weighted averages of costs incurred over two or more accounting
periods.
Other Issues in Process Costing
Several other issues related to process costing are worth discussion.
Actual versus Normal Costing
Our illustration of process costing assumed that n ormal costing was used. As explained
in Chapter 3, in a normal-costing system, direct material and direct labor are applied
to Work-in-Process Inventory at their a ctual amounts, but manufacturing overhead is
applied to Work-in-Process Inventory using a predetermined overhead rate. In contrast,
under an a ctual-costing system, the actual costs of direct material, direct labor, a nd man-
ufacturing overhead are entered into Work-in-Process Inventory.
Either actual or normal costing may be used in conjunction with a process-
costing system. Our illustration used normal costing since a predetermined overhead
rate was used to compute applied manufacturing overhead in Exhibit 4–4 . This resulted
in applied overhead for March of $107,500 (125% " $86,000). If actual costing had
been used, the manufacturing overhead cost for March would have been the actual
overhead cost incurred instead of the applied overhead amount given in Exhibit 4–4 .
In all other ways, the process-costing procedures used under actual and normal costing
are identical.
When normal costing is used, there may be overapplied or underapplied overhead at
the end of the period. This amount is either closed into Cost of Goods Sold or prorated,
as explained in Chapter 3.
Other Cost Drivers for Overhead Application
Our illustration used a predetermined overhead rate based on direct-labor cost. Since
the application of manufacturing overhead was based on direct-labor cost, direct labor
and manufacturing overhead were combined into the single cost element conversion
costs. This procedure is quite common in practice. If some cost driver (or activity base)
other than direct labor had been used to apply manufacturing overhead, then overhead
costs would be accounted for separately from direct-labor costs in the process-costing
calculations.
Suppose, for example, that manufacturing overhead is applied on the basis of
machine hours. A group of 100 physical units is 100 percent complete as to direct mate-
rial, 60 percent complete as to direct labor, and 40 percent complete as to machine time.
This situation could arise in a production process that is labor-intensive in its early stages
hiL10912_ch04_134-167.indd 147 7/8/10 9:28 AM
================================================================================

148 Chapter 4 Process Costing and Hybrid Product-Costing Systems
but more automated in its later stages. In this case, the 100 physical units represent the
following quantities of equivalent units:
Equivalent Units
Physical Units Direct Material Direct Labor Manufacturing Overhead
100 100 60 40
100 " 100% 100 " 60% 100 " 40%
Throughout the entire process-costing procedure, there will now be three cost elements
(direct material, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead) instead of only two (direct
material and conversion). In all other respects, the process-costing calculations will be
identical to those illustrated earlier in the chapter.
Subsequent Production Departments
In our illustration, production requires two sequential production operations: cutting
and stitching. Although the process-costing procedures for the second department are
similar to those illustrated for the first, there is one additional consideration. The cost of
goods completed and transferred out of the Cutting Department must remain assigned
to the partially completed product units as they undergo further processing in the Stitch-
ing Department. Process-costing procedures for subsequent production departments are
covered in cost accounting texts. 3
Hybrid Product-Costing Systems
Job-order and process costing represent the polar extremes of product-costing sys-
tems. However, some production processes exhibit characteristics of both job-order and
process-costing environments. Examples of such production processes include some
clothing and food-processing operations. In these production processes, the conver-
sion activities may be very similar or identical across all of the firm’s product lines,
even though the direct materials may differ significantly. Different clothing lines require
significantly different direct materials, such as cotton, silk, or wool. However, the con-
version of these materials, involving direct labor and manufacturing overhead, may not
differ much across product types. In the food industry, production of economy-grade
or premium applesauce differs with regard to the quality and cost of the direct-material
input, apples. However, the cooking, straining, and canning operations for these two
product lines are nearly identical.

differ significantly. C onversion costs are accumulated by d epartment, and process-
costing methods are used to assign these costs to products. In contrast, direct-material
costs are accumulated by job order or batch, and job-order costing is used to assign
material costs to products.
The main features of operation costing are illustrated in Exhibit 4–10 . Notice in the
exhibit that products pass sequentially through production departments A and B. Direct-
material costs are traced directly to each batch of goods, but conversion costs are applied
on a departmental basis. Direct labor and manufacturing overhead are combined in a sin-
gle cost category called conversion costs, rather than separately identifying direct labor.
Moreover, under operation costing, conversion costs are applied to products using a p re-
determined application rate. This predetermined rate is based on b udgeted conversion
costs, as follows:4

basketballs: professional balls, which have genuine leather exteriors, and scholastic balls,
which use imitation leather. The cutting and stitching operations for the two different MVP
products are identical. Scholastic balls are sold without special packaging, but profes-

152 Chapter 4 Process Costing and Hybrid Product-Costing Systems
Suppose that at the end of an accounting period, applied conversion costs differ from
the actual conversion costs incurred. Then the difference, called overapplied or under-
applied conversion costs, would be closed into Cost of Goods Sold. This accounting treat-
ment is similar to that described in Chapter 3 for overapplied or underapplied overhead.
Chapter Summary
LO1 List and explain the similarities and important differences between job-order and process
costing. Process costing is used in production processes where relatively large numbers of nearly iden-
tical products are manufactured. The purpose of a process-costing system is the same as that of a job-
order costing system—to accumulate costs and assign these costs to units of product. Job-order costing
is used by firms that produce relatively small numbers of dissimilar products.
LO2 Prepare journal entries to record the flow of costs in a process-costing system with sequen-
tial production departments. Costs of direct material, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead are
added to a Work-in-Process Inventory account. Direct labor and manufacturing overhead often are
combined into a single cost category termed conversion costs. When products are completed, the costs
assigned to them are transferred either to Finished-Goods Inventory or to the next production depart-
ment’s Work-in-Process Inventory account. Finally, when goods are sold, their costs are transferred to
the expense account called Cost of Goods Sold.
LO3 Prepare a table of equivalent units under weighted-average process costing. The table of
equivalent units, illustrated in the chapter, computes the equivalent units of activity for the period for
both direct material and conversion costs.
LO4 Compute the cost per equivalent unit under the weighted-average method of process cost-
ing. The cost per equivalent unit, for both direct material and conversion, is calculated as shown in the
chapter. For each factor input, direct material and conversion, the cost of that input is divided by the
number of equivalent units for that input.
LO5 Analyze the total production costs for a department under the weighted-average method
of process costing. T he total production costs incurred during the period, for both direct material and
conversion, are assigned to either ending work-in-process inventory or to the cost of goods completed
and transferred out.
LO6 Prepare a departmental production report under weighted-average process costing. As
illustrated in the chapter, there are four steps in preparing a departmental production report: (1) analyze
the physical flow of units, (2) calculate the equivalent units, (3) compute the cost per equivalent unit,
and (4) analyze the total costs of the department. In the weighted-average method of process costing,
the cost per equivalent unit, for each cost category, is a weighted average of (1) the costs assigned to the
beginning work-in-process inventory and (2) the costs incurred during the current period.
LO7 Describe how an operation costing system accumulates and assigns the costs of direct mate-
rial and conversion activity in a batch manufacturing process. Operation costing is a hybrid of job-
order and process costing. It is designed for production processes in which the direct material differs
significantly among product lines, but the conversion activities are essentially the same. Direct-material
costs are accumulated by batches of products using job-order costing methods. Conversion costs are
accumulated by production departments and are assigned to product units using process-costing methods.

conversion costs. Murray has approached his friend, Jeff Daley, who is the corporate controller,
with the following request: “Jeff, I’m under pressure to reduce costs in the production process.
There is no way to reduce material cost, so I’ve got to get the conversion costs down. If I can
show just a little progress in next week’s meeting with the president, then I can buy a little time
to try some other cost-cutting measures I’ve been considering. I want you to do me a favor. If we
raise the estimate of the percentage of completion of October’s inventory to 60 percent, that will
increase the number of equivalent units. Then the unit conversion cost will be a little lower.” By
how much would Murray’s suggested manipulation lower the unit conversion cost? What should
Daley do? Discuss this situation, citing specific ethical standards for managerial accountants.

FOCUS COMPANY >>>
THIS CHAPTER’S FOCUS COMPANY is the Patio Grill Company, which
manufactures high-end gas barbeque grills in its Denver plant. The company
has recently experienced intense competition in its two high-volume product lines, forcing man-
agement to drop these products’ prices below their target levels. A careful study of this situa-
tion revealed that Patio Grill Company’s traditional
product-costing system distorted product
costs by assigning too much cost to
the high-volume gas-grill lines and not
enough cost to the low-volume, complex
line of grills. Management then implemented a
new costing system, called activity-based costing, or
ABC, which assigns product costs more accurately than
traditional product-costing systems. Armed with the
cost insights from the ABC system, management
was able to change its pricing structure to compete
more effectively in the gas-grill market.

A revolution is transforming the world of business. Not since the mid-19th century have
we seen changes as sweeping and dramatic. The growth of international competition,
the breakneck pace of technological innovation, and startling advances in computer-
ized systems have created a new playing field for manufacturers around the globe. Some
manufacturers have emerged as world-class producers, while others have fallen by the
wayside. World-class companies such as Caterpillar, Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, and
P fizer are among the many manufacturers that have changed key business processes to
compete effectively in the 21st century.
The service industry also is undergoing dramatic transformation. The growth of
the Internet, the trend toward a service economy, and the willingness of businesses to
outsource many critical service functions have caused many service organizations to
reinvent the way they do business. Among the many service-industry firms that have
adapted most successfully to the changing business environment are American Express,
Bank of America, FedEx, Google, and Southwest Airlines.
What is the role of managerial accounting in this rapidly changing environment?
To explore this issue, we will review recent events in the life of Patio Grill Company, a
manufacturer of barbeque grills and accessories. The company’s Denver plant manufac-
tures three product lines, all high-end gas barbeque grills. The plant’s three gas grill lines
are the Patio Standard (STD), the Deluxe (DEL), and the Ultimate (ULT).

Chapter 5 Activity-Based Costing and Management 171
Traditional, Volume-Based Product-Costing System
Until recently, Patio Grill Company’s Denver plant used a job-order product-costing
Learning Objective 1
system similar to the one described in Chapter 3 for Adirondack Outfitters. The cost of
each product was the sum of its actual direct-material cost, actual direct-labor cost, and Compute product costs under
applied manufacturing overhead. Overhead was applied using a predetermined overhead a traditional, volume-based
rate based on direct-labor hours. E xhibit 5–1 provides the basic data upon which the product-costing system.
traditional costing system was based.
The Excel spreadsheet in Exhibit 5–2 shows the calculation of the product cost for
each of three gas-grill lines (STD, DEL, and ULT). Overhead is applied to the products at
the rate of $24 per direct-labor hour. Notice that all of the Denver plant’s budgeted manu-
facturing overhead costs are lumped together in a single cost pool. This total budgeted
overhead amount ($4,896,000) then is divided by the plant’s total budgeted direct-labor
hours (204,000 hours). The 204,000 direct labor hours is also equal to the plant’s practi-
cal capacity for production, as expressed in terms of direct-labor hours.
Patio Grill Company’s labor-hour-based product-costing system is typical of many
manufacturing companies. Labor hours are related closely to the volume of activity in
the factory, which sometimes is referred to as t hroughput. Consequently, these traditional
product-costing systems often are said to be v olume-based (or t hroughput-based) cost-
ing systems.
Trouble in Denver
The profitability of Patio Grill Company’s Denver operation has been faltering in recent
years. The company’s pricing policy has been to set a target price for each grill equal
to 120 percent of the full product cost. Thus, the prices were determined as shown in
Exhibit 5–3 . Also shown are the actual prices that Patio Grill Company has been obtain-
ing for its products.
Due to price competition from other grill manufacturers, Patio Standard (STD) grills
were selling at $585, approximately $10 below their target price of $595.20. Moreover,
Patio Grill Company’s competition had forced management to reduce the price of the
Deluxe grill (DEL) to $705, almost $20 below its target price of $724.80. Even at this
lower price, the sales team was having difficulty getting orders for its planned volume of
Deluxe grill production. Fortunately, the disappointing profitability of the Patio Standard
and Deluxe model grills was partially offset by greater-than expected profits on the Ulti-
mate (ULT) line of grills. Patio Grill Company’s sales personnel had discovered that the
company was swamped with orders when the Ultimate grill’s target price of $902.40 was
charged. Consequently, management had raised the price on the Ultimate grills several
times, and eventually the product was selling for $940. Even at this price, Patio Grill
Company’s customers did not seem to hesitate to place orders. Moreover, the company’s

competitors did not mount a challenge in the market for the Ultimate line of grills. Patio’s
management was pleased to have a niche for the Ultimate grill market, which appeared to
be a highly profitable, low-volume specialty product. Nevertheless, concern continued to
mount in Denver about the difficulty in the Patio Standard and Deluxe grill markets. After
all, these were the Denver plant’s bread-and-butter products, with projected annual sales
of 10,000 Patio Standard grills and 8,000 Deluxe grills.

Burger discussed activity-based costing with Patty Cook, the assistant director of
cost management. Together they met with all of Patio Grill Company’s department super-
visors to discuss development of an ABC system. After initial discussion, an ABC pro-
posal was made to the company’s top management. Approval was obtained, and an ABC
project team was formed, which included Burger, Cook, and representatives of various
functional departments. Through several months of painstaking data collection and anal-
ysis, the project team was able to gather the data necessary to implement an ABC system.
ABC Stage One
Patio Grill Company’s ABC project team identified eight activity cost pools, which fall
into four broad categories.
1. Unit level. This type of activity must be done for each unit of production. The
Learning Objective 3
machine-related activity cost pool represents a u nit-level activity since every
product unit requires machine time. Explain the concept of cost
2. Batch level. These activities must be performed for each batch of products, levels, including unit-level,
rather than each unit. Patio Grill Company’s b atch-level activities include the batch-level, product-
sustaining-level, and facility-
setup, purchasing, material handling, quality assurance, and packing/shipping
level costs.
activity cost pools.
3. Product-sustaining level. This category includes activities that are needed to
support an entire product line but are not performed every time a new unit or
batch of products is produced. Patio Grill Company’s project team identified
engineering design costs as a p roduct-sustaining-level activity cost pool.
4. F acility (or general operations) level. F acility-level activities are required in
order for the entire production process to occur. Examples of such activity costs
include plant management salaries, plant depreciation, property taxes, plant
maintenance, and insurance.
This classification of activities into unit-level, batch-level, product-sustaining-level, and
facility-level activities is called a c ost hierarchy.

company’s gas-grill product lines.
Machine-Related Cost Pool Let’s begin by focusing on only one of the
eight activity cost pools. The machine-related cost pool, a unit-level activity, totals
$1,242,000 and includes the costs of machine maintenance, depreciation, computer

support, lubrication, electricity, and calibration. Burger and Cook selected machine
hours for the cost driver, since a product that uses more machine hours should bear
a larger share of machine-related costs. Exhibit 5–6 shows how machinery costs are
assigned to products in stage two of the ABC analysis. Notice that Exhibit 5–6 includes
just a portion of a larger spreadsheet that we will examine in due course. The spread-
sheet rows shown in Exhibit 5–6 focus just on the machine-related activity cost pool.
Most of the columns in Exhibit 5–6 contain ABC data that were collected by the ABC
project team. We will learn more later in this chapter about how that information is

Data Collected by ABC Project Team (Exhibit 5–6)
Column A Activity: machine related
Column B Activity cost pool: $1,242,000 (from Exhibit 5–5)
Column C Cost driver: machine hours
Column D Cost driver quantity: 230,000 machine hours (total of machine hours for the three product lines in column G)1
Column F Product lines: STD, DEL, ULT
Column G Cost driver quantity for each product line: STD, 100,000 machine hours (from Exhibit 5–1)
DEL, 96,000 machine hours (from Exhibit 5–1)
ULT, 34,000 machine hours (from Exhibit 5–1)
Column I Product line production volume: STD, 10,000 units (from Exhibit 5–1)
DEL, 8,000 units (from Exhibit 5–1)
ULT, 2,000 units (from Exhibit 5–1)
Notice that only three columns in Exhibit 5–6 remain: columns E, H, and J. These
columns contain the a mounts that are c omputed during the ABC calculations, and they
appear in red in Exhibit 5–6 .
Amounts Computed During ABC Calculations (Exhibit 5–6)
Column E Pool rate
Column H Activity cost for each product line
Column J Activity cost per unit of product for each product line
Exhibit 5–6 , below the spreadsheet excerpt, shows in detail how each of these amounts
(shown in red) is computed. Take time now to examine Exhibit 5–6 carefully, in order to
understand how these amounts are computed in the ABC calculations.
A key number computed in Exhibit 5–6 (column E) is the pool rate, which is
defined as the cost per unit of the c ost driver for a particular activity cost pool. The pool
rate for the machine-related cost pool is $5.40, which means that Patio Grill Company’s
machine-related cost is $5.40 per machine hour. Each activity cost pool will have its own
pool rate.
Now we have seen the type of data that the ABC project team must supply for the
machine-related cost pool. In addition, we have studied how the ABC calculations are
carried out in order to determine the machine-related activity cost per unit of each type
of product (STD, DEL, and ULT). The final conclusion of the ABC analysis for the
machine-related cost pool only is given in column J of E xhibit 5–6. Thus, under activity-
based costing, the following machine-related costs per product unit should be assigned to
each of the three product lines.
STD: $54.00 of machine-related cost per grill
DEL: $64.80 of machine-related cost per grill
ULT: $91.80 of machine-related cost per grill
1 The 230,000 machine hours used to compute the pool rate for the machine-related cost pool is also equal to
management’s estimate of the company’s practical capacity of production, as expressed in terms of machine
hours.

than the machine-related activity we studied earlier. Try to verify the computations of the

Now that we have the activity cost per unit of product for each activity cost pool and
each product line, it is straightforward to compute the total unit product cost for each type
of grill. To do so, we need only add the direct-material and direct-labor costs for each
grill type (given in Exhibit 5–1 ) to the ABC activity costs calculated in Exhibit 5–7 . We
do this in the Excel spreadsheet displayed as Exhibit 5–8 .

Product Costs from Activity-
Based Costing System: Patio
Grill Company
Interpreting the ABC Product Costs
Hamilton Burger was amazed to see the product costs reported under the activity-based
costing system. Both the STD and DEL grills exhibited lower product costs under the
ABC system than under the traditional system. This could explain the price competition
Patio Grill Company faced on its STD and DEL grills. Patio Grill Company’s competi-
tors could sell their comparable standard and deluxe grills at a lower price because they
realized it cost less to produce these grills than Patio Grill Company’s traditional cost-
ing system had indicated. However, as Burger scanned the new product costs shown in
Exhibit 5–8 , he was alarmed by the substantial increase in the reported cost of an ULT
grill. The cost of an ULT grill had risen by more than $100 above the company’s original
estimate. The complexity of the ULT grills, and its impact on costs, was hidden by the
traditional, volume-based costing system. To compare the results of the two alternative
costing systems, Burger prepared Exhibit 5–9 .
As shown in Exhibit 5–9 , the STD grills emerged as a profitable product, selling for
approximately 120 percent of their reported cost under the activity-based costing system
($585 ! $487). The DEL grills also were selling at approximately 120 percent of their
new reported product cost ($705 ! $586.30). “No wonder we couldn’t sell the deluxe

grills at the old target price of $724.80,” said Burger to Cook, as they looked over the
data. “Our competitors probably knew their deluxe grills cost around $586, and they
priced them accordingly.” When he got to the ULT column in Exhibit 5–9 , Burger was
appalled. “We thought those ultimate grills were a winner,” lamented Burger, “but we’ve
been selling them at a price that is just about 8 percent over their cost!” (Burger had made
this calculation: actual current selling price of $940 ! ABC product cost of $867.80.)
“And worse yet,” Burger continued, “we’ve been selling the ultimate grills for $940,
which is more than a hundred dollars below the new target price of $1,041.36.” After
looking over the data, Burger made a beeline for the president’s office. “We’ve got to get
this operation straightened out,” he thought.
Burger also realized that the comparison of the two product-costing systems was
even more striking when he focused on just the reported o verhead costs. He commented
to Cook, “The direct-material and direct-labor costs for each product line don’t change
under ABC. They’re the same under both costing systems. Since these are direct costs,
it’s straightforward to trace these costs to each product with considerable accuracy. It’s the
overhead costs that cause the problem.” To see what Burger was getting at, look again at
Exhibit 5–9 and focus on the top two rows. The overhead cost of a STD grill dropped from
the old reported cost of $216 to $207 under ABC. Similarly, the overhead cost of a DEL
grill dropped from the old reported cost of $264 to $246.30 under ABC. Now look at the
ULT column, though. Here the overhead cost rose from the old reported cost of $312 to
$427.80 under ABC! This represents an increase of more than a third. ($427.80 ! $312.00
is a little over 137 percent, which yields an increase of over 37 percent.)
The Punch Line
What has happened at Patio Grill Company’s Denver plant? The essence of the problem

head costs to the three product lines.
Exhibit 5–10 summarizes the effects of the cost distortion under the traditional
product-costing system. Patio Grill Company’s traditional system o vercosted each STD
grill by $9.00, for a total of $90,000 for the STD product line on a volume of 10,000
units. Each DEL grill was overcosted by $17.70, for a total of $141,600 on a volume of
8,000 units for the DEL product line. These excess costs had to come from somewhere,
and that place was the ULT product line. Each ULT grill was u ndercosted by $115.80,
for a total of $231,600 for the ULT product line on a volume of 2,000 units. Notice that
the total amount by which the STD and DEL grill lines were overcosted equals the total
amount by which the ULT grill line was undercosted.

Why Traditional, Volume-Based Systems
Distort Product Costs
Why did Patio Grill Company’s traditional product-costing system distort its product
costs? The answer lies in the use of a single, volume-based cost driver. The company’s
old costing system assigned overhead to products on the basis of their relative usage of
direct labor. Since the STD and DEL grill lines use substantially more direct labor than
the ULT grill line, in total, the traditional system assigned them more overhead costs.
The problem with this result is that for every one of Patio Grill Company’s overhead
activities, the proportion of the activity actually consumed by the ULT grill line is far
greater than its low volume would suggest. The ULT grill line has a budgeted production
volume of just 2,000 units, which is only 10 percent of Patio Grill Company’s total bud-
geted production volume of 20,000 units. (20,000 units # 10,000 STD units $ 8,000
DEL units $ 2,000 ULT units.) Now examine the ABC calculations in Exhibit 5–7 .
Focus on column G, which details the consumption of the cost driver by each product
line for each activity cost pool. Notice that for every one of the overhead activities, the
ULT grill line consumes much more than a 10 percent share of the activity, even though
the ULT line accounts for only 10 percent of budgeted production volume. The relatively
heavy consumption of overhead activities by the ULT product line is due to its greater
complexity and small production runs. We must conclude, therefore, that direct labor is

Chapter 5 Activity-Based Costing and Management 181
not a suitable cost driver for Patio Grill Company’s overhead costs. Usage of direct labor
does not drive most overhead costs in this company.
There are actually two factors working against Patio Grill Company’s old product-
costing system. First, many of the activities that result in the company’s overhead costs
are n ot unit-level activities. Second, the company manufactures a diverse set of products.
Non-Unit-Level Overhead Costs When Patio Grill Company’s ABC project
team designed the activity-based costing system, only the machine-related overhead cost
pool was classified as a unit-level activity. All of the other activities were classified as
batch-level, product-sustaining-level, or facility-level activities. This means that many of
the company’s overhead costs are not incurred every time a unit is produced. Instead,
many of these overhead costs are related to starting new production batches, supporting an
entire product line, or running the entire operation. Since direct labor is a unit-level cost
driver, it fails to capture the forces that drive these other types of costs. In Patio Grill Com-
pany’s new ABC system, cost drivers were chosen that were appropriate for each activity
cost pool. For example, since setting up machinery for a new production run is a batch-
level activity, the number of production runs is an appropriate batch-level cost driver.
Product Diversity Patio Grill Company manufactures three different products.
Although all three are gas barbeque grills, the three grills are quite different. The STD
and DEL grills are high-volume, relatively simple products. The ULT grills constitute
a considerably more complex, and relatively low-volume, product line. As a result of
this p roduct line diversity, Patio Grill Company’s three product lines consume overhead
activities in different proportions. For example, compare the consumption ratios for the
purchasing and material-handling activity cost pools shown below. The consumption
ratio is the proportion of an activity consumed by a particular product.
Consumption Ratios*
Activity Cost Pool STD DEL ULT
Purchasing activity (cost driver is
purchase orders, or POs) ......................................................... 200 POs (33%) 192 POs (32%) 208 POs (35%)
Material-handling activity (cost driver is
production runs) ...................................................................... 80 runs (40%) 80 runs (40%) 40 runs (20%)
*The purchase order and production run data come from Exhibit 5–7.
These widely varying consumption ratios result from Patio Grill Company’s product
line diversity. A single cost driver will not capture the widely differing usage of these
activities by the three products. The activity-based costing system uses two different cost
drivers to assign these costs to the company’s diverse products.
Two Key Points To summarize, each of the following characteristics will under-
mine the ability of a volume-based product-costing system to assign overhead costs
accurately.
• A large proportion of non-unit-level activities. A unit-level cost driver, such as
direct labor, machine hours, or throughput, will not be able to assign the costs of
non-unit-level activities accurately.
• Product diversity. When the consumption ratios differ widely between activities,
no single cost driver will accurately assign the resulting overhead costs.
When either of these characteristics is present, a volume-based product-costing
system is likely to distort product costs.
Does the sort of product-cost distortion experienced by Patio Grill Company occur
in other companies? The answer is yes, as illustrated by the following examples from
R ockwell International and DHL express transport service. (See tops of next two pages.)

applied costs to products in proportion to direct-labor costs, had resulted in major distor-
tions. The reported product costs for high-volume axles were approximately 20 percent
too high, and the low-volume axles were being undercosted by roughly 40 percent. The
firm’s practice of basing prices on reported product costs resulted in the overpricing of
the high-volume axles. As a consequence, Rockwell’s competitors entered the market for
the high-volume axle business.2

from ABC are such diverse organizations as the British Navy, the California Depart-
ment of Taxation, the City of Indianapolis, and several agencies of the U.S. government,
including the I mmigration and Naturalization Service, the Internal Revenue Service, the
V eterans Affairs Department, and the U .S. Postal Service.
An important factor in the move toward ABC systems is related to the information
requirements of such systems. The data required for activity-based costing are more read-
ily available than in the past. Increasing automation, coupled with sophisticated real-time
information systems, provides the kind of data necessary to implement highly accurate
product-costing systems. Some key issues related to activity-based costing systems are
discussed in the following sections.

costs. In activity-based costing systems, the most significant cost drivers are identified.
Then a database is created, which shows how these cost drivers are distributed across Explain three criteria for select-
products. Three factors are important in selecting appropriate cost drivers.3 ing cost drivers.
1. Degree of correlation. The central concept of an activity-based costing system
is to assign the costs of each activity to product lines on the basis of how each
product line consumes the cost driver identified for that activity. The idea is to
infer how each product line consumes the activity by o bserving how each prod-
uct line consumes the cost driver. Therefore, the accuracy of the resulting cost
assignments depends on the d egree of correlation between consumption of the
activity and consumption of the cost driver.
Say that inspection cost is selected as an activity cost pool. The objective
of the ABC system is to assign inspection costs to product lines on the basis of
their consumption of the inspection activity. Two potential cost drivers come
to mind: number of inspections and hours of inspection time. If every inspec-
tion requires the same amount of time for all products, then the number of
inspections on a product line will be highly correlated with the consumption of
inspection activity by that product line. On the other hand, if inspections vary “ABC is not a magic bullet,

2. C ost of measurement. Designing any information system entails cost-benefit
trade-offs. The more activity cost pools there are in an activity-based costing
system, the greater will be the accuracy of the cost assignments. However,
more activity cost pools also entail more cost drivers, which results in greater
costs of implementing and maintaining the system.
Similarly, the higher the correlation between a cost driver and the
actual consumption of the associated activity, the greater the accuracy of

also may have a desirable behavioral effect of inducing managers to reduce the
number of times materials are moved, thereby reducing material-handling costs.
Dysfunctional behavioral effects are also possible. For example, the num-
ber of vendor contacts may be a cost driver for the purchasing activity of vendor
selection. This could induce purchasing managers to contact fewer vendors, which
could result in the failure to identify the lowest-cost or highest-quality vendor.

Corporation analysis, they made considerable use of another technique for collecting activity data.
Storyboarding is a procedure used to develop a detailed process flowchart, which visu-
ally represents activities and the relationships among the activities. A storyboarding ses-
sion involves all or most of the employees who participate in the activities oriented toward
achieving a specific objective. A facilitator helps the employees identify the key activities
involved in their jobs. These activities are written on small cards and placed on a large
board in the order they are accomplished. Relationships among the activities are shown
by the order and proximity of the cards. Other information about the activities is recorded
on the cards, such as the amount of time and other resources that are expended on each
activity and the events that trigger the activity. After several storyboarding sessions, a
completed storyboard emerges, recording key activity information vital to the ABC proj-
ect. Historically, storyboards have been used by Walt Disney and other film producers in
the development of plots for animated films. More recently, storyboarding has been used
by advertising agencies in developing event sequences for TV commercials.

Interviews with department personnel and storyboarding sessions are often used by activity-based costing
project teams to accumulate the data needed for an ABC study. In the interview sessions, an ABC project team
member asks departmental employees to detail their activities, as well as the time and other resources con-
sumed by the activities. Storyboards, like the one depicted here, visually show the relationships between the
activities performed in an organization.
Storyboarding provides a powerful tool for collecting and organizing the data needed
in an ABC project. Patio Grill Company’s ABC project team used storyboarding very
effectively to study each of the firm’s activity cost pools. The team concluded that pur-
chasing costs were driven by the number of purchase orders. Material-handling costs
were driven by the number of production runs. Quality-assurance costs were driven by
the number of inspection hours devoted to each product line. Packaging and shipping
costs were driven by the number of shipments made.
In summary, the ABC project team conducted a painstaking and lengthy analysis
involving many employee interviews, the examination of hundreds of documents, and
storyboarding sessions. The final result was the data used in the ABC calculations dis-
played in Exhibits 5–7 and 5–8 .
Multidisciplinary ABC Project Teams In order to gather information from all
facets of an organization’s operations, it is essential to involve personnel from a variety
of functional areas. A typical ABC project team includes accounting and finance people
as well as engineers, marketing personnel, production and operations managers, and so
forth. A multidisciplinary project team not only designs a better ABC system but also
helps in gaining credibility for the new system throughout the organization.

globs of dough on greased cookie sheet, bake at 375 & for 10 minutes or until done).
Activity-Based Management
Using activity-based costing (ABC) information to support organizational strategy,
Learning Objective 8
improve operations, and manage costs is called activity-based management or ABM.
Explain the concepts of We have already caught a glimpse of activity-based management earlier in this chapter,
activity-based management where the management of Patio Grill Company used ABC information to better under-
and two-dimensional ABC. stand its product-pricing decisions. The company’s management discovered through the
ABC analysis that some products were overcosted and some products were undercosted
by their traditional product-costing system. This important insight presented manage-
ment with the opportunity to revise its product pricing in order to reflect the more accu-
rate product costs provided by the ABC analysis. When management followed up on this
product-pricing opportunity, it was engaging in activity-based management. However,
ABM is a much broader concept than this. Activity-based management involves any use
of ABC information to support the organization’s strategy, improve operations, or man-
age activities and their resulting costs.
Two-Dimensional ABC
One way of picturing the relationship between ABC and ABM is in terms of the t wo-
dimensional ABC model depicted in E xhibit 5–11. 4 The vertical dimension of the model
depicts the cost assignment view of an ABC system. From the c ost assignment viewpoint,
the ABC system uses two-stage cost allocation to assign the costs of resources to the
firm’s cost objects. These cost objects could be products manufactured, services pro-
duced, or customers served.
Now focus on the horizontal dimension of the model. Depicted here is the p rocess
view of an ABC system. The emphasis now is on the activities themselves, the vari-
ous processes by which work is accomplished in the organization. The left-hand side of
Exhibit 5–11 depicts a ctivity analysis, which is the detailed identification and descrip-
tion of the activities conducted in the enterprise. Activity analysis entails identification
not only of the activities but also of their root causes, the events that trigger activities,
and the linkages among activities. The right-hand side of Exhibit 5–11 depicts the evalu-
ation of activities through performance measures. It is these processes of activity analy-
sis and evaluation that comprise activity-based management. Notice that the a ctivities,
which appear in the center of both dimensions in Exhibit 5–11 , are the focal point of
ABC and ABM.
Using ABM to Identify Non-Value-Added Activities and Costs
An important goal of activity-based management is to identify and eliminate non-value-
added activities and costs. Non-value-added activities are operations that are either
(1) unnecessary and dispensable or (2) necessary, but inefficient and improvable. 5 Non-
value-added costs, which result from such activities, are the costs of activities that can
be eliminated without deterioration of product quality, performance, or perceived value.

The following five steps provide a strategy for eliminating non-value-added costs in both
manufacturing and service industry firms.
Identifying Activities The first step is activity analysis, which identifies all of the
organization’s significant activities. The resulting activity list should be broken down to
the most fundamental level practical. For example, rather than listing purchasing as an
activity, the list should break down the purchasing operation into its component activities,
such as obtaining part specifications, compiling vendor lists, selecting vendors, negotiat-
ing prices, ordering, and expediting.
Identifying Non-Value-Added Activities Three criteria for determining
whether an activity adds value are as follows:
“Putting a spotlight on
• I s the activity necessary? If it’s a duplicate or nonessential operation, it is
non-value-added activities,
non-value-added.
such as [correcting] errors
• I s the activity efficiently performed? In answering this question, it is helpful to
in procurement, provided
compare the actual performance of the activity to a value-added baseline estab-
the focus for ultimately
lished using budgets, targets, or external benchmarks.
implementing process
• I s an activity sometimes value-added and sometimes non-value-added? For improvements.” (5f )
example, it may be necessary to move work-in-process units between GTE Supply
production operations, but unnecessary to move raw materials around while (currently a part of Verizon)
in storage.

188 Chapter 5 Activity-Based Costing and Management
Understanding Activity Linkages, Root Causes, and Triggers In
identifying non-value-added activities, it is critical to understand the ways in which activ-
ities are linked together. The following chain of activities provides an example:
Rework of
Specification Vendor Receipt of Inspection of
Production defective
of parts selection parts finished goods
products
The rework of defective units is a non-value-added activity. The rework is t riggered by
the identification of defective products during inspection. The root cause of the rework,
however, could lie in any one of a number of preceding activities. Perhaps the part speci-
fications were in error. Possibly an unreliable vendor was selected. Maybe the wrong
parts were received. Perhaps the production activity is to blame.
A set of linked activities (such as that depicted above) is called a p rocess. Sometimes
activity analysis is referred to as p rocess value analysis (PVA).
Establishing Performance Measures By continually measuring the perfor-
mance of all activities, and comparing performance with benchmarks, management’s
attention may be directed to unnecessary or inefficient activities. We will explore perfor-
mance measurement extensively in Chapters 10 and 11.
Reporting Non-Value-Added Costs Non-value-added costs should be
highlighted in activity center cost reports. By identifying non-value-added activities,
and reporting their costs, management can strive toward the ongoing goals of process
improvement and elimination of non-value-added costs.
One approach that cost-management analysts find helpful in identifying non-value-
added activities is to categorize the ways in which time is spent in a production process.
Let’s return to our illustration of Patio Grill Company’s Denver plant, where gas barbeque
grills are manufactured. How is time spent in the plant from the time raw material arrives
until a finished gas grill is shipped to a customer? As in most manufacturing operations,
time is spent in the following five ways.
1. Process time. The time during which a product is undergoing conversion activity.
2. Inspection time. The amount of time spent ensuring that the product is of high
quality.
3. Move time. The time spent moving raw materials, work in process, or finished
goods between operations.
4. W aiting time. The amount of time that raw materials or work in process spend
waiting for the next operation.
5. S torage time. The time during which materials, partially completed products,
or finished goods are held in stock before further processing or shipment to
customers.
Thinking about the production operation in these terms allows management to ask
the questions, “Does the time spent in all of these activities add value to the product? Will
the customer pay for it? Can the time spent on inspection be reduced without diminishing
product quality? Can production efficiency be improved by reducing the number of times
materials, work-in-process, or finished goods are moved from one place to another? Can
production be scheduled so that partially completed products spend less time just waiting
for the next operation? Can storage time be reduced by ordering raw material and pro-
ducing products only as they are needed?” Many companies have implemented just-in-
time (JIT) inventory and production management systems to reduce move, waiting, and
storage time. JIT systems are covered in the appendix to this chapter.
If reductions can be made in any of these time-consuming activities, without dimin-
ishing product quality or functionality, management has a real opportunity to reduce
non-value-added costs.

Chapter 5 Activity-Based Costing and Management 189
Some companies have begun making a distinction between c ustomer-value-added
activities and b usiness-value-added activities. For example, the addition of a 24/7
customer-service hotline to assist customers in maximizing their benefits from the prod-
ucts or services they have purchased would likely be an activity that customers would
value. In contrast, most customers would not value a company’s expenditures on infor-
mation technology (IT) or accounting, whereas these activities are likely to be critical to
the success of the company’s business model.
Customer-Profitability Analysis
It is quite possible for a company to have profitable products and, at the same time, incur
Learning Objective 9
customer-related costs that make certain customer relationships unprofitable. C ustomer-
profitability analysis uses activity-based costing to determine the activities, costs, and Explain and execute a
profit associated with serving particular customers. Suppose, for example, that customer X customer-profitability analysis.
frequently changes its orders after they are placed, but customer Y typically does not. Then
the costs incurred in updating sales orders for changes should be recorded in a manner that
reflects the fact that customer X is more responsible for those activities and costs than is
customer Y. An effective cost management system should allow managers to derive such
cost details.
Many factors can result in some customers being more profitable than others. Cus-
tomers that order in small quantities, order frequently, often change their orders, require
special packaging or handling, demand faster delivery, or need special parts or engi-
neering design generally are less profitable than customers who demand less in terms
of customized services. If managers have a good understanding of which customers are
generating the greatest profit, they can make more-informed decisions about customer
service. Moreover, this allows customers to be educated as to the costs they are causing
when demanding special services. In many cases, customers’ behavior can be changed
in a way that reduces costs to the supplier. Then these cost savings can be shared by the
supplier and the customer.
The task of assigning costs to customers is a challenge. A system must be in place
that enables the company to identify which customers are using customer support services
and how frequently they do so. How much time must the company spend on a customer to
make the sale and to provide ongoing support services? These costs are in addition to the
cost of manufacturing the product or initially providing a service for the customer.
Illustration of Customer-Profitability Analysis
To illustrate customer-profitability analysis, let’s focus again on Patio Grill Company.
Two more years have passed, and the company has successfully implemented its activity-
based costing system in its Denver plant. At a recent strategy meeting with her senior
management team, Patio Grill Company’s president and CEO expressed interest in
assessing the profitability of the entire company’s various customer relationships. She
found support for the idea from the director of cost management, who had been reading
about customer-profitability analysis in some of his professional journals. The company’s
marketing manager also expressed interest in customer-profitability analysis, since he
was concerned about the profitability of a couple of Patio Grill Company’s customers in
particular. “We have a few customers who seem to want the moon and the stars when it
comes to customer service,” he complained. “I know the customer is always right and all,
but you really have to wonder if we’re making any money from a couple of these custom-
ers, what with all the extra design and packaging they demand. And some of our other
customers seem to require an awful lot of extra attention in sales calls, order processing,
and billing. If we had a better idea of each customer’s profitability, it would help our mar-
keting and sales staffs to focus their efforts.”
The controller soon had his cost management staff attacking the customer-
profitability analysis that the president had requested. The first step required an
activity-based costing analysis of certain c ustomer-related costs that could seriously

some of our customers facility- or general-operations-level costs. In this use of activity-based costing, the cost

6 An important point that could be overlooked here is that activity-based costing analysis can be used in a very
specific, targeted manner to address a particular management problem. In this case, the ABC focus is customer-
profitability analysis. This is the essence of activity-based management, using the results of an ABC analysis to
manage an enterprise more effectively.

ing a heretical notion for a retailer. He wants to separate the best customers among the
1.5 million people who visit Best Buy’s stores every day from the worst customers.” Best
Buy’s preferred customers “boost profits at the consumer-electronics giant by snapping
up high-definition televisions, portable electronics, and newly released DVDs without wait-
ing for markdowns or rebates.”1 0 The retailer’s worst customers, on the other hand, “buy
products, apply for rebates, return the purchases, and then buy them back at returned-
merchandise discounts. They load up on loss-leaders, severely discounted merchan-
dise designed to boost store traffic, then “flip” the goods at a profit on e Bay. They slap

enormous economic havoc.” The company estimates “that as many as 100 million of its
500 million customer visits each year are undesirable.” And Best Buy’s CEO “wants to
be rid of these customers.” The company’s new approach “upends what has long been

its 670 stores. Best Buy “is examin-

these activity classifications in its ABC system. 1 2 Examples from the Blue Shield system
are as follows:
• Unit level: Entering initial claim data into the computer (for each claim
received).
• Batch level: Moving a batch of claims from one processing step to the next.
• Product-sustaining level: Maintenance of the medical-services provider network

care to claimants).
• F acility (general operations) level: General administration of the claims busi-

Activity-Based Costing at Delaware Medical Center
To see how management can use activity-based costing in a service-industry setting, let’s
explore how ABC is used at Delaware Medical Center’s Primary Care Unit.1 3 Delaware
DDelaware
Medical Center serves patients in Wilmington, Delaware, and several surrounding counties.
MMedical
The Primary Care Unit is the medical center’s outpatient clinic and provides nearly 25,000
CCenter
patient appointments in a typical year. The Primary Care Unit’s administration imple-
mented activity-based costing in order to determine how much it costs to serve patients
in various categories. The Primary Care Unit classifies patient appointments as routine,
extended, or complex, depending on the appointment length and complexity. In addition,
each appointment is classified as either a new-patient appointment or a continuing-patient
appointment. Thus, every patient appointment is one of the following six types.
Routine Extended Complex
New New patient; New patient; New patient;
patient routine appointment extended appointment complex appointment
Continuing Continuing patient; Continuing patient; Continuing patient;
patient routine appointment extended appointment complex appointment
Every patient appointment involves a registered nurse (or RN), who takes vital signs
and prepares the patient for the primary health care professional. Then, every patient is
seen by one primary health care professional, which can be a physician, a nurse practi-
tioner, an intern, or a resident. No appointment involves more than one of these types of
primary health care professionals.
The Primary Care Unit’s ABC project team designated the following activities and
cost drivers.
Activity Cost Driver
Physician time Physician minutes with patient
Nurse practitioner time Nurse practitioner minutes with patient
Intern or resident time Intern or resident minutes with patient
Registered nurse time Registered nurse minutes with patient
Clerical time: new patients New patient visits
Clerical time: continuing patients Continuing patient visits
Billing Billing lines (i.e., number of line items on bill)
Facility Patient visits (both new and continuing)
The activity-based costing analysis is displayed in the Excel spreadsheet in
Exhibit 5–16 . Notice that this ABC spreadsheet for Delaware Medical Center’s Primary
Care Unit has a format that is identical to the ABC spreadsheet prepared for Patio Grill
Company ( Exhibit 5–7 on page 177). The column headings are different, because the
Primary Care Unit provides medical services to patients, whereas Patio Grill Company
manufactures barbeque grills. Conceptually and computationally, however, the two Excel
spreadsheets are identical.
The information supplied by the primary care unit’s ABC project team is located in
the following columns.
Column A: Activity

Column C: Cost driver

Interpreting the Primary Care Unit’s ABC Information
The Primary Care Unit’s administration can use the ABC information in Exhibit 5–16
to determine the cost of each of the six types of patient appointments discussed earlier.
Notice, though, that there is an important conceptual difference in the interpretation
of the Primary Care Unit’s ABC data ( Exhibit 5–16 ) versus the interpretation of Patio
Grill Company’s ABC data ( Exhibit 5–7 on page 177). In the Patio Grill Company
manufacturing illustration, a ll eight of the activities identified in the ABC analysis were
required by each line of barbeque grills manufactured. However, that is not true in the
Primary Care Unit example. In this health care services setting, each patient sees either
a physician, o r a nurse practitioner, o r an intern, o r a resident—not all four. Moreover,
each patient is e ither a new patient o r a continuing patient—not both. Therefore, to
compute the cost of a particular type of appointment, we must select only one of the pri-
mary health care professionals, which are highlighted by the red bar on the right-hand
side of Exhibit 5–16 . Moreover, we select j ust one of the two categories for clerical
time, new patient or continuing patient, which are highlighted by the green bar on the
right-hand side of Exhibit 5–16 . Finally, since every patient appointment involves a reg-
istered nurse, and billing, a nd use of the primary care unit facility, a ll of these activities
must be included in the cost calculation. (These activities are highlighted by the yellow
bars on the right-hand side of Exhibit 5–16 .)
Let’s compute the cost of an extended appointment in which a new patient sees a
nurse practitioner.

With a good understanding of how much it costs the Primary Care Unit to provide
various types of patient appointments, the clinic’s administration is in a much better posi-
tion to make decisions. Determining appropriate charges for appointments, justifying
third-party reimbursements from insurance companies and government agencies, and
adding or discontinuing services are among the types of decisions that will be enhanced

Chapter Summary
LO1 Compute product costs under a traditional, volume-based product-costing system. Tradi-
tional product-costing systems are structured on single, volume-based cost drivers, such as direct labor
or machine hours. Overhead is applied to production jobs using a predetermined overhead rate, which
is based on estimates of manufacturing overhead (in the numerator) and the level of some cost driver (in
the denominator).
LO2 Explain how an activity-based costing system operates, including the use of a two-stage
procedure for cost assignment, the identification of activity cost pools, and the selection of
cost drivers. In the first stage of ABC, resource costs are identified and divided into activity cost
pools. In the second stage, a cost driver is selected for each activity cost pool, and the costs in
each pool are assigned to cost objects, such as products, services, product lines, customers, and
so forth.
LO3 Explain the concept of cost levels, including unit-level, batch-level, product-sustaining-
level, and facility-level costs. Unit-level costs are incurred for each unit produced. Batch-level costs
are incurred once for each batch of products (i.e., one production run). Product-sustaining-level costs
are incurred once for each product line. Facility-level costs are incurred to keep the overall facility in
operation.
LO4 Compute product costs under an activity-based costing system. A product’s cost is the sum of
its direct-material cost, its direct-labor cost, and its overhead cost, which is the accumulation of all the
resource costs driven to the product by the various cost drivers selected for the ABC system.
LO5 Explain why traditional, volume-based costing systems tend to distort product costs. Tra-
ditional, volume-based costing systems tend to distort product costs because of two factors:
(1) product-line diversity and (2) non-unit-level overhead costs. No single cost driver can capture
the complex relationships between products and the myriad activities necessary to produce and sell
them.
LO6 Explain three criteria for selecting cost drivers. Three criteria for selecting cost drivers are:
(1) the degree of correlation between the cost driver and the incurrence of costs in the activity cost pool
associated with the cost driver; (2) the cost of measurement of the cost driver; and (3) the behavioral
effects that might result from the selection of a cost driver.
LO7 Discuss several key issues in activity-based costing, including data collection and story-
boarding. Collecting ABC data is difficult and costly. Techniques for data collection include inter-
views, examination of work product and other documentation, and sometimes storyboarding, which is a
detailed map of the processes used in the organization.
LO8 Explain the concepts of activity-based management and two-dimensional ABC. Activity-
based management (ABM) is the use of activity-based costing information to improve operations and
eliminate non-value-added costs. One way of depicting ABM is the two-dimensional ABC model. This
model combines the cost assignment role of ABC with the process and activity evaluation view of an
ABC system.

LO9 Explain and execute a customer-profitability analysis. Customer profitability analysis is an
application of ABM in which management determines the cost drivers for customer-related costs. The
resulting ABC information is then used to assess the profitability of key customer relationships.
LO10 U nderstand and discuss how activity-based costing is used in service-industry orga-
nizations. Activity-based costing has found widespread successful implementation in the service
industry. The application of ABC in the service industry is similar to that in manufacturing, wherein
a two-stage costing model is used that first assigns resource costs to activity cost pools and then uses
cost drivers to assign the costs in these pools to the various services provided and customers served.
Many service-industry firms are implementing ABC and ABM systems to better meet the needs of
management.
LO11 L ist and explain eight important features of just-in-time inventory and production man-
agement systems (Appendix). The key features of JIT systems are: (1) a smooth, uniform pro-
duction rate; (2) a pull method of coordinating steps in the production process; (3) purchase and
manufacturing in small lot sizes; (4) quick and inexpensive machine setups; (5) high quality levels
for raw materials and finished products; (6) effective preventive maintenance of equipment; (7) an
atmosphere of teamwork to improve the production process; and (8) multiskilled workers and flexible
facilities.

APPENDIX TO CHAPTER 5
Just-in-Time Inventory
and Production Management
A cost management tool that is widely used in manufacturing is the just-in-time (or JIT ) system. A just-
in-time (JIT) inventory and production management system is a comprehensive inventory and man- Learning Objective 11

to fill customer orders. A primary goal of a JIT production system is to r educe or eliminate inventories
at every stage of production, from raw materials to finished goods. The JIT philosophy, made famous by
Toyota, has been credited with the success of many of the world’s leading manufacturers. Tremendous
cost savings have been realized by many companies that have adopted the JIT approach.
How does a JIT system achieve its vast reductions in inventory and associated cost savings? A
production-systems expert lists the following key features of the JIT approach.1 4
1. A smooth, uniform production rate. An important goal of a JIT system is to establish a smooth
production flow, beginning with the arrival of materials from suppliers and ending with the
delivery of goods to customers.
2. A pull method of coordinating steps in the production process. Most manufacturing processes
occur in multiple stages. Under the pull method, goods are produced in each manufacturing
stage only as they are needed at the next stage. This approach reduces or eliminates work-in-
process inventory between production steps. The result is a reduction in waiting time and its
associated non-value-added cost.
The pull method of production begins at the last stage of the manufacturing process.1 5
When additional materials and parts are needed for final assembly, a message is sent to the
immediately preceding work center to send the amount of materials and parts that will be
needed over the next few hours. Often this message is in the form of a withdrawal Kanban,
a card indicating the number and type of parts requested from the preceding work center. The
receipt of the withdrawal Kanban in the preceding work center triggers the release of a produc-
tion Kanban, which is another card specifying the number of parts to be manufactured in that
work center. Thus, the parts are “pulled” from a particular work center by a need for parts in the
subsequent work center. This pull approach to production is repeated all the way back through
the manufacturing sequence toward the beginning. Nothing is manufactured at any stage until
its need is signaled from the subsequent process via a Kanban.1 6
3. Purchase of materials and manufacture of subassemblies and products in small lot sizes. This is
an outgrowth of the pull method of production planning. Materials are purchased and goods are
produced only as required, rather than for the sake of building up stocks.
4. Quick and inexpensive setups of production machinery. In order to produce in small lot sizes, a
manufacturer must be able to set up production runs quickly. Advanced manufacturing technol-
ogy aids in this process, as more and more machines are computer-controlled.
5. High quality levels for raw material and finished products. If raw materials and parts are to
arrive “just in time” for production, they must be “just right” for their intended purpose. Other-
wise, the production line will be shut down and significant non-value-added costs of waiting will
result. Moreover, if very small stocks of finished goods are to be maintained, then finished

15 You may find it helpful to review Exhibit 1–5 on page 24, which depicts the pull method of the JIT system.
16 Toyota’s ground-breaking JIT system originally was referred to as K anban, a Japanese word meaning “signboard.”

202 Chapter 5 Activity-Based Costing and Management
products must be of uniform high quality. For this reason, a total quality control (TQC)
program often accompanies a just-in-time production environment.
6. E ffective preventive maintenance of equipment. If goods are to be manufactured just in time to
meet customer orders, a manufacturer cannot afford significant production delays. By strictly
adhering to routine maintenance schedules, the firm can avoid costly down time from machine
breakdowns.
7. An atmosphere of teamwork to improve the production system. A company can maintain a
competitive edge in today’s worldwide market only if it is constantly seeking ways to improve
its product or service, achieve more efficient operations, and eliminate non-value-added costs.
My favorite football coach often says that a team must improve from one week to the next.
Otherwise the team will get worse, because it rarely will stay at the same level. So it goes in
business as well. If a company’s employees are not constantly seeking ways to improve the
firm’s performance, before long its competitors will pass it by.
8. M ultiskilled workers and flexible facilities. To facilitate just-in-time production, manufacturing
equipment must be flexible enough to produce a variety of components and products. Otherwise,
if a particular production line can produce only one item, bottlenecks may result. A bottleneck
can hold up production in subsequent manufacturing stages and result in the non-value-added
costs associated with waiting time.
JIT Purchasing Along with a JIT production approach, many companies implement J IT purchasing.
Under this approach, materials and parts are purchased from outside vendors only as they are needed.
This avoids the costly and wasteful buildup of raw-material inventories. The following are five key
features of J IT purchasing.
1. O nly a few suppliers. This results in less time spent on vendor relations. Only highly reliable
vendors, who can invariably deliver high-quality goods on time, are used.
2. L ong-term contracts negotiated with suppliers. This eliminates costly paperwork and negotia-
tions with each individual transaction. The need for delivery can be communicated via a tele-
phone call or computer message. The long-term contracts state the price, quality, and delivery
terms of the goods.
3. M aterials and parts delivered in small lot sizes immediately before they are needed. This is the
essence of the just-in-time approach. Costly inventories are avoided by having supplies arrive
“just-in-time” to be placed into production.
4. O nly minimal inspection of delivered materials and parts. The long-term contracts clearly state
the quality of material required. Vendors are selected on the basis of their reliability in meeting
these stringent standards and in delivering the correct amount of materials on time.
5. G rouped payments to each vendor. Instead of paying for each delivery, payments are made for
batches of deliveries according to the terms of the contract. This reduces costly paperwork for
both the vendor and the purchaser.
JIT purchasing is widely used in a variety of organizations. In manufacturing firms, it goes hand in
hand with JIT production. In retail and service industry firms, JIT purchasing reduces costly warehouse
inventories and streamlines the purchasing function.

Lately, Wheelco’s profits have been declining. Foreign competitors have been undercutting Wheel-
co’s prices in three of its bread-and-butter product lines, and Wheelco’s sales volume and market share
have declined. In contrast, Wheelco’s specialty wheels have been selling steadily, although in relatively
small numbers, in spite of three recent price increases. At a recent staff meeting. Wheelco’s president
made the following remarks: “Our profits are going down the tubes, folks. It costs us 29 dollars to
manufacture our A22 wheel. That’s our best seller, with a volume last year of 17,000 units. But our
chief competitor is selling basically the same wheel for 27 bucks. I don’t see how they can do it. I think
it’s just one more example of foreign dumping. I’m going to write my senator about it! Thank goodness
for our specialty wheels. I think we’ve got to get our salespeople to push those wheels more and more.

Activities
following:
(LO 2, 3, 7)
1. Trimming: At the end of a growing season, the vines are trimmed, which helps
prepare them for the next harvest.
2. Tying: The vines are tied onto wires to help protect them from the cold.
(This also occurs at the end of the season.)
3. Hilling: Dirt is piled up around the roots to help protect them from frost.
4. Conditioning: A fter the snow melts in the spring, dirt is leveled back from the roots.
5. Untying: The vines are untied from the wires to allow them freedom to grow
during the spring and summer months.
6. Chemical spraying: T he vines are sprayed in the spring to protect them from disease and
insects.
7. Harvesting: All of the grapes of both varieties are picked by hand to minimize
damage.
8. Stemming and crushing: Batches of grapes are hand-loaded into a machine, which gently re-
moves the stems and mildly crushes them.
9. Pressing: After removal from the stemmer/crusher, the juice runs freely from
the grapes.
10. Filtering: T he grapes are crushed mechanically to render more juice from them.
11. Fermentation: T he riesling grape juice is placed in stainless steel tanks for fermenta-
tion. The chardonnay grape juice undergoes a two-stage fermentation
process in oak barrels.
12. Aging: The riesling wines are aged in the stainless steel tanks for approxi-
mately a year. The chardonnays are aged in the oak barrels for
about two years.
13. Bottling: A machine bottles the wine and corks the bottles.
14. Labeling: E ach bottle is manually labeled with the name of the vintner, vintage,
and variety.
15. Packing: The bottles are manually packed in 12-bottle cases.
16. Case labeling: The cases are hand-stamped with the same information that the
bottles received.
17. Shipping: The wine is shipped to wine distributors and retailers, mainly in
central New York. Generally, about 100 cases are shipped at a time.
18. Maintenance on buildings: This is done during the slow winter months.
19. Maintenance on equipment: This is done when needed, and on a routine basis for preventive
maintenance.
Required: Classify each of the activities listed as a unit-, batch-, product-sustaining-, or facility-level
activity.

Chapter 5 Activity-Based Costing and Management 207
After studying the costs incurred over the past two years for one of its products, skeins of knitting
yarn, Jackson has selected four categories of selling costs and chosen cost drivers for each of these costs.
The selling costs actually incurred during the past year and the cost drivers are as follows:
Cost Category Amount Cost Driver
Sales commissions .................................................................. $ 675,000 Boxes of yam sold to retail stores
Catalogs .................................................................................. 295,400 Catalogs distributed
Cost of catalog sales ................................................................ 105,000 Skeins sold through catalog
Credit and collection ................................................................ 60,000 Number of retail orders
Total selling costs ..................................................................... $1,135,400
The knitting yarn is sold to retail outlets in boxes, each containing 12 skeins of yarn. The sale of
partial boxes is not permitted. Commissions are paid on sales to retail outlets but not on catalog sales.
The cost of catalog sales includes telephone costs and the wages of personnel who take the catalog
orders. Jackson believes that the selling costs vary significantly with the size of the order. Order sizes are
divided into three categories as follows:
Order Size Catalog Sales Retail Sales
Small ........................................................................................................... 1–10 skeins 1–10 boxes
Medium ........................................................................................................ 11–20 skeins 11–20 boxes
Large ........................................................................................................... Over 20 skeins Over 20 boxes
An analysis of the previous year’s records produced the following statistics.
Order Size
Small Medium Large Total
Retail sales in boxes (12 skeins per box) ............................................... 2,000 45,000 178,000 225,000
Catalog sales in skeins ........................................................................ 79,000 52,000 44,000 175,000
Number of retail orders ....................................................................... 485 2,415 3,100 6,000
Catalogs distributed ............................................................................ 254,300 211,300 125,200 590,800
Required:
1. Prepare a schedule showing Redwood Company’s total selling cost for each order size and the per-
skein selling cost within each order size.
2. Explain how the analysis of the selling costs for skeins of knitting yarn is likely to impact future
pricing and product decisions at Redwood Company.

quality, a computerized video QC system was purchased for $250,000. The system consists of a minicom- (LO 1, 2, 7)
puter, 15 video cameras, other peripheral hardware, and software. The new system uses cameras stationed
by QC engineers at key points in the production process. Each time an operation changes or there is a new
operation, the cameras are moved, and a new master picture is loaded into the computer by a QC engineer.
The camera takes pictures of the units in process, and the computer compares them to the picture of a
“good” unit. Any differences are sent to a QC engineer, who removes the bad units and discusses the flaws
with the production supervisors. The new system has replaced the 10 QC inspectors with two QC engineers.
The operating costs of the new QC system, including the salaries of the QC engineers, have been
included as factory overhead in calculating the company’s plantwide manufacturing-overhead rate,
which is based on direct-labor dollars. The company’s president is confused. His vice president of pro-
duction has told him how efficient the new system is. Yet there is a large increase in the overhead rate.
The computation of the rate before and after automation is as follows:

Ontario’s overhead of $800,000 can be identified with three major activities: order processing
($150,000), machine processing ($560,000), and product inspection ($90,000). These activities are
driven by number of orders processed, machine hours worked, and inspection hours, respectively. Data
relevant to these activities follow.

Top management is very concerned about declining profitability despite a healthy increase in sales
volume. The decrease in income is especially puzzling because the company recently undertook a
massive plant renovation during which new, highly automated machinery was installed—machinery
that was expected to produce significant operating efficiencies.
Required:
1. Assuming use of direct-labor hours to apply overhead to production, compute the unit manufactur-
ing costs of the Standard and Enhanced products if the expected manufacturing volume is attained.
2. Assuming use of activity-based costing, compute the unit manufacturing costs of the Standard and
Enhanced products if the expected manufacturing volume is attained.
3. Ontario’s selling prices are based heavily on cost.
a. By using direct-labor hours as an application base, which product is overcosted and which
product is undercosted? Calculate the amount of the cost distortion for each product.
b. Is it possible that overcosting and undercosting (i.e., cost distortion) and the subsequent deter-
mination of selling prices are contributing to the company’s profit woes? Explain.
4. B uild a spreadsheet: Construct an Excel spreadsheet to solve requirements 1, 2, and 3(a ) above.

The annual budgeted overhead is $1,224,000, and the company’s predetermined overhead rate is
$12 per direct-labor hour. The product costs for the three product models, as reported under the plant’s
traditional costing system, are shown in the following table.

Kitchen King’s pricing policy is to set a target price for each product equal to 130 percent of the full
product cost. Due to price competition from other appliance manufacturers, REG units were selling at $525,
and ADV units were selling for $628. These prices were somewhat below the firm’s target prices. However,
these results were partially offset by greater-than-expected profits on the GMT product line. Management
had raised the price on the GMT model to $800, which was higher than the original target price. Even at this
price, Kitchen King’s customers did not seem to hesitate to place orders, Moreover, the company’s compe-
titiors did not mount a challenge in the market for the GMT product line. Neverthless, concern continued to
mount in Toledo about the difficulty in the REG and ADV markets. After all, these were the plant’s bread-
and-butter products, with projected annual sales of 5,000 REG units and 4,000 ADV units.
Kitchen King’s director of cost management, Angela Ramirez, had been thinking for some time
about a refinement in the Toledo plant’s product-costing system. Ramirez wondered if the traditional,
volume-based system was providing management with accurate data about product costs. She had read
about activity-based costing, and wondered if ABC would be an improvement to the plant’s product-
costing system. After some discussion, an ABC proposal was made to the company’s top management,
and approval was obtained. The data collected for the new ABC system is displayed in the following table.

Overhead Application;
is currently investigating ways to modernize its manufacturing process. At the first staff meeting Patrick
Activity-Based Costing
attended, Jack Kielshesky, chief engineer, presented a proposal for automating the Molding Department.
(LO 1, 2, 5, 8)
Kielshesky recommended that the company purchase two robots that would have the capability of replac-
ing the eight direct-labor employees in the department. The cost savings outlined in the proposal include
the elimination of direct-labor cost in the Molding Department plus a reduction of manufacturing overhead
cost in the department to zero, because VVC charges manufacturing overhead on the basis of direct-labor
dollars using a plantwide rate. The president of VVC was puzzled by Kielshesky’s explanation: “This just
doesn’t make any sense. How can a department’s overhead rate drop to zero by adding expensive, high-
tech manufacturing equipment? If anything, it seems like the rate ought to go up.”
Kielshesky responded by saying “I’m an engineer, not an accountant. But if we’re charging over-
head on the basis of direct labor, and we eliminate the labor, then we eliminate the overhead.”
Patrick agreed with the president. He explained that as firms become more automated, they should
rethink their product-costing systems. The president then asked Patrick to look into the matter and
prepare a report for the next staff meeting. Patrick gathered the following data on the manufacturing-
overhead rates experienced by VVC over the years. Patrick also wanted to have some departmental data
to present at the meeting and, by using VVC’s accounting records, he was able to estimate the following
annual averages for each manufacturing department over the five decades since VVC’s formation.

Required:
1. Disregarding the proposed use of robots in the Molding Department, describe the shortcomings of
the system for applying overhead that is currently used by Valdosta Vinyl Company.
2. Explain the misconceptions underlying Kielshesky’s statement that the manufacturing-overhead
cost in the Molding Department will be reduced to zero if the automation proposal is
implemented.
3. Recommend ways to improve VVC’s method for applying overhead by describing how it should

Manchester’s management group is meeting to discuss how to spend the sales and promotion dol- $2,557,100
lars for 20x1. The sales manager believes that the market share for the TV board could be expanded by
concentrating Manchester’s promotional efforts in this area. In response to this suggestion, the produc-
tion manager said, “Why don’t you go after a bigger market for the PC board? The cost sheets that I get
show that the contribution from the PC board is more than double the contribution from the TV board. I
E
know we get a premium price for the PC board. Selling it should help overall profitability.” x
The cost-accounting system shows that the following costs apply to the PC and TV boards.

Direct labor ..................................................................................................................... 4 hr. 1.5 hr.
Machine time .................................................................................................................. 1.5 hr. .5 hr.
Variable manufacturing overhead is applied on the basis of direct-labor hours. For 20x1, variable
overhead is budgeted at $1,120,000, and direct-labor hours are estimated at 280,000. The hourly rates for
machine time and direct labor are $10 and $14, respectively. The company applies a material-handling
charge at 10 percent of material cost. This material-handling charge is not included in variable manufac-
turing overhead. Total 20x1 expenditures for direct material are budgeted at $10,800,000.
Andrew Fulton, Manchester’s controller, believes that before the management group proceeds with
the discussion about allocating sales and promotional dollars to individual products, it might be worth-
while to look at these products on the basis of the activities involved in their production. Fulton has
prepared the following schedule to help the management group understand this concept.
“Using this information,” Fulton explained, “we can calculate an activity-based cost for each TV
board and each PC board and then compare it to the standard cost we have been using. The only cost that
remains the same for both cost methods is the cost of direct material. The cost drivers will replace the
direct labor, machine time, and overhead costs in the old standard cost figures.”

Kona Some of the coffees are very popular and sell in large volumes, while a few of the newer blends
have very low volumes. WGCC prices its coffee at full product cost, including allocated overhead, plus
a markup of 30 percent. If prices for certain coffees are significantly higher than market, adjustments
are made. The company competes primarily on the quality of its products, but customers are price-
conscious as well.

Knickknack, Inc. prices its products at 120 percent of cost, which yields target prices of $199.20 for
odds and $298.80 for ends. Recently, however, Knickknack has been challenged in the market for ends
by a European competitor, Bricabrac Corporation. A new entrant in this market, Bricabrac has been sell-
ing ends for $220 each. Knickknack’s president is puzzled by Bricabrac’s ability to sell ends at such a
low cost. She has asked you (the controller) to look into the matter. You have decided that Knickknack’s
traditional, volume-based product-costing system may be causing cost distortion between the firm’s two
products. Ends are a high-volume, relatively simple product. Odds, on the other hand, are quite complex
and exhibit a much lower volume. As a result, you have begun work on an activity-based costing system.
Required:
1. Let each of the overhead categories in the budget represent an activity cost pool. Categorize each
in terms of the type of activity (e.g., unit-level activity).
2. The following cost drivers have been identified for the four activity cost pools.
Activity Cost Pool Cost Driver Budgeted Level of Cost Driver
Machine-related costs Machine hours 9,000 hr.

You have gathered the following additional information:
• Each odd requires 4 machine hours, whereas each end requires 1 machine hour.
• Odds are manufactured in production runs of 50 units each. Ends are manufactured in 250-unit
batches.
• Three-quarters of the engineering activity, as measured in terms of change orders, is related to odds.
• The plant has 1,920 square feet of space, 80 percent of which is used in the production of odds.
For each activity cost pool, compute a pool rate. (H int: Regarding the pool rate refer to Exhibit 5–6 .)
3. Determine the unit cost, for each activity cost pool, for odds and ends.
4. Compute the new product cost per unit for odds and ends, using the ABC system.
5. Using the same pricing policy as in the past, compute prices for odds and ends. Use the product
costs determined by the ABC system.
6. Show that the ABC system fully assigns the total budgeted manufacturing overhead costs of
$816,000.
7. Show how Knickknack’s traditional, volume-based costing system distorted its product costs.

Northwest Aircraft Industries (NAI) was founded 45 years ago by Jay Preston as a small machine shop

producing machined parts for the aircraft industry, which is prominent in the Seattle/Tacoma area of
Forecasting; Ethics
Washington. By the end of its first decade, NAI’s annual sales had reached $15 million, almost exclusively

under government contracts. The next 30 years brought slow but steady growth as cost-reimbursement
1. Total Material-Handling government contracts continued to be the main source of revenue. Realizing that NAI could not depend

4. Cumulative impact of as a percentage of direct-material dollar value. This was adequate when the majority of the manufactur-
recommended change in ing was homogeneous and related to government contracts. Recently, however, government auditors
allocating Material-Handling have rejected some proposals, stating that “the amount of Material-Handling Department costs allocated
Department costs: $234,346 to these proposals is disproportionate to the total effort involved.”
Kara Lindley, the newly hired cost-accounting manager, was asked by the manager of the Govern-
ment Contracts Unit, Paul Anderson, to find a more equitable method of allocating Material-Handling
Department costs to the user departments. Her review has revealed the following information.
• The majority of the direct-material purchases for government contracts are high-dollar, low-volume
purchases, while commercial materials represent low-dollar, high-volume purchases.
• Administrative departments such as marketing, finance and administration, human resources, and
maintenance also use the services of the Material-Handling Department on a limited basis but have
never been charged in the past for material-handling costs.
• One purchasing agent with a direct phone line is assigned exclusively to purchasing high-dollar,
low-volume material for government contracts at an annual salary of $36,000. Employee benefits are
estimated to be 20 percent of the annual salary. The annual dedicated phone line costs are $2,800.
The components of the Material-Handling Department’s budget for 20x1, as proposed by Lindley’s
predecessor, are as follows:
Payroll ........................................................................................................................................................ $ 180,000
Employee benefits ....................................................................................................................................... 36,000
Telephone ................................................................................................................................................... 38,000

Materials and supplies ................................................................................................................................ 6,000
Depreciation ............................................................................................................................................... 6,000

Lindley has estimated the number of purchase orders to be processed in 20x1 to be as follows:
Government contracts* .................................................................................................................................... 80,000
Commercial products ...................................................................................................................................... 156,000

*Exclusive of high-dollar, low-volume materials.
Lindley recommended to Anderson that material-handling costs be allocated on a per-purchase-
order basis. Anderson realizes and accepts that the company has been allocating to government con-
tracts more material-handling costs than can be justified. However, the implication of Lindley’s analysis
could be a decrease in his unit’s earnings and, consequently, a cut in his annual bonus. Anderson told
Lindley to “adjust” her numbers and modify her recommendation so that the results will be more favor-
able to the Government Contracts Unit.
Being new in her position, Lindley is not sure how to proceed. She feels ambivalent about Ander-
son’s instructions and suspects his motivation. To complicate matters for Lindley, Preston has asked her
to prepare a three-year forecast of the Government Contracts Unit’s results, and she believes that the
newly recommended allocation method would provide the most accurate data. However, this would put
her in direct opposition to Anderson’s directives.
Lindley has assembled the following data to project the material-handling costs.
• Total direct-material costs increase 2.5 percent per year.
• Material-handling costs remain the same percentage of direct-material costs.
• Direct government costs (payroll, employee benefits, and direct phone line) remain constant.
• The number of purchase orders increases 5 percent per year.
• The ratio of government purchase orders to total purchase orders remains at 33 percent.
• In addition, she has assumed that government material in the future will be 70 percent of total material.
Required:
1. Calculate the material-handling rate that would have been used by Kara Lindley’s predecessor at
Northwest Aircraft Industries.
2. a. Calculate the revised material-handling costs to be allocated on a per-purchase-order basis.
b. Discuss why purchase orders might be a more reliable cost driver than the dollar amount of
direct material.
3. Calculate the difference due to the change to the new method of allocating material-handling costs
to government contracts.
4. Prepare a forecast of the cumulative dollar impact over a three-year period from 20x1 through
20x3 of Kara Lindley’s recommended change for allocating Material-Handling Department costs
to the Government Contracts Unit. Round all calculations to the nearest whole number.
5. Referring to the standards of ethical conduct for management accountants:
a. Discuss why Kara Lindley has an ethical conflict.
b. Identify several steps that Lindley could take to resolve the ethical conflict.

The two major indirect costs for manufacturing the products are power usage and setup costs. Most
of the power is used in fabricating, while most of the setup costs are required in assembly. The setup
costs are predominantly related to the Tuff Stuff product line.
A decision was made to separate the Manufacturing Department costs into two activity cost pools
as follows:
Fabricating: machine hours will be the cost driver.
Assembly: number of setups will be the cost driver.

Gigabyte has been forced to lower the price of gismos in order to get orders. In contrast, Gigabyte
has raised the price of whatchamacallits several times, but there has been no apparent loss of sales.
Gigabyte, Inc. has been under increasing pressure to reduce the price even further on gismos. In con-
trast, Gigabyte’s competitors do not seem to be interested in the market for whatchamacallits. Gigabyte
apparently has this market to itself.

management to understand its product costs better. She got top management’s approval to design
an activity-based costing system, and an ABC project team was formed. In stage one of the ABC
project, each of the overhead items listed in the overhead budget was placed into its own activity
cost pool. Then a cost driver was identified for each activity cost pool. Finally, the ABC project

procedure to accommodate different sizes and styles of bagels. Workers remove the uncooked
bagels and place them on a tray, where they are kept until a boiling vat is free.
6. Next the trays of uncooked bagels are carried into an adjoining room, which houses three
50-gallon vats of boiling water. The bagels are boiled for approximately one minute.
7. Bagels are removed from the vats with a long-handled strainer and placed on a wooden board.
The boards full of bagels are carried to the oven room, where they are kept until an oven rack is
free. The two ovens contain eight racks which rotate but remain upright, much like the seats on
a Ferris wheel. A rack full of bagels is finished baking after one complete revolution in the oven.
When a rack full of bagels is removed from the oven, a fresh rack replaces it. The oven door is
opened and closed as each rack completes a revolution in the oven.
8. After the bagels are removed from the oven, they are placed in baskets for cooling.
9. While the bagels are cooling, they are inspected. Misshapen bagels are removed and set aside.
(Most are eaten by the staff.)
10. After the bagels are cool, the wire baskets are carried to the packaging department. Here the
bagels are dumped into the hopper on a bagging machine. This machine packages a half-dozen
bagels in each bag and seals the bag with a twist tie.
11. Then the packaged bagels are placed in cardboard boxes, each holding 24 bags. The boxes are placed
on a forklift and are driven to the freezer, where the bagels are frozen and stored for shipment.
Required:
1. Identify the steps in the bagel-production process that fall into each of the following categories:

Mark Ward, Whitestone’s president, has been reading about a product-costing method called activity-
based costing. Ward is convinced that activity-based costing will cast a new light on future profits. As a
result, Brian Walters, Whitestone’s director of cost management, has accumulated cost pool information
for this year shown on the following chart. This information is based on a product mix of 5,000 units of
JR-14 and 5,000 units of RM-13.

On January 1, 20x2, Whitestone is planning to increase the prices of JR-14 to $355 and RM-13 to $455.
Material costs are not expected to increase in 20x2, but direct labor will increase by 8 percent, and
all manufacturing overhead costs will increase by 6 percent. Due to the nature of the manufacturing
process, the company does not have any beginning or ending work-in-process inventories.
Whitestone uses a just-in-time inventory system and has materials delivered to the production facil-
ity directly from the vendors. The raw-material inventory at both the beginning and the end of the month
is immaterial and can be ignored for the purposes of a budgeted income statement. The company uses
the first-in, first-out (FIFO) inventory method.
Required:
1. Explain how activity-based costing differs from traditional product-costing methods.
2. Using activity-based costing, calculate the total cost for the following activity cost pools: machin-
ing, assembly, material handling, and inspection. (Round to the nearest dollar.) Then, calculate
the pool rate per unit of the appropriate cost driver for each of the four activities. (H int: Refer to
Exhibit 5–6 , regarding calculation of the pool rate.)
3. Prepare a table showing for each product line the estimated 20x2 cost for each of the following
cost elements: direct material, direct labor, machining, assembly, material handling, and inspection.
(Round to the nearest dollar.)
4. Prepare a budgeted statement showing the gross margin for Whitestone Company for 20x2, using
activity-based costing. The statement should show each product and a total for the company. Be
sure to include detailed calculations for the cost of goods manufactured and sold. (Round each
amount in the statement to the nearest dollar.)

For the past 10 years, the company’s pricing formula has been to set each product’s target price
at 110 percent of its full product cost. Recently, however, the standard-model motor has come under
increasing price pressure from offshore competitors. The result was that the price on the standard model
has been lowered to $110.
The company president recently asked the controller, “Why can’t we compete with these other
companies? They’re selling motors just like our standard model for 106 dollars. That’s only a buck more
than our production cost. Are we really that inefficient? What gives?”
The controller responded by saying, “I think this is due to an outmoded product-costing system. As
you may remember, I raised a red flag about our system when I came on board last year. But the decision
was to keep our current system in place. In my judgment, our product-costing system is distorting our
product costs. Let me run a few numbers to demonstrate what I mean.”
Getting the president’s go-ahead, the controller compiled the basic data needed to implement an
activity-based costing system. These data are displayed in the following table. The percentages are the
proportion of each cost driver consumed by each product line.

gotten wind of your new product-cost analysis. There’s no way the deluxe model costs anywhere near
what your numbers say. For years and years, this line has been highly profitable, and its reported product
cost was low. Now you’re telling us it costs more than twice what we thought. I just don’t buy it.”
Jackson briefly explained to her friend about the principles of activity-based costing and why it
resulted in more accurate product costs. “Alan, the deluxe model is really losing money. It simply has
too low a volume to be manufactured efficiently.”
Tyler was even more upset now. “Erin, if you report these new product costs to the president, he’s
going to discontinue the deluxe model. My job’s on the line, Erin! How about massaging those numbers
a little bit. Who’s going to know?”
“I’ll know, Alan. And you’ll know,” responded Jackson. “Look, I’ll go over my analysis again, just
to make sure I haven’t made an error.”
Required: Discuss the ethical issues involved in this scenario.

2. Is the production manager, Alan Tyler, acting ethically?

THIS CHAPTER’S FOCUS COMPANY is Tasty Donuts, Inc., a Canadian chain

D NUTS
of 10 donut shops in Toronto, Ontario. Using the Tasty Donuts illustration,
we explore cost behavior, cost estimation, and cost prediction. Cost behavior refers to
the relationship between cost and activity. Variable and fixed costs, which we studied in
Chapter 2, are two examples of the many types of
cost behavior. Cost estimation is the process of
determining how a particular cost behaves,
often relying on historical cost data. Cost
prediction means using our knowledge
of cost behavior to forecast the cost
to be incurred at a particular level
of activity. Cost analysis helps Tasty
Donuts’ management plan for the costs
to be incurred at various levels of donut
sales activity.

Activity Analysis, Cost
Behavior, and Cost
Estimation
IN CONTRAST >>>
In contrast to the service-industry setting of Tasty Donuts, we turn to a
manufacturing environment to explore the effect of the learning curve on cost
behavior. In many production processes, production efficiency increases with experience. As cumula-
tive production output increases, the average labor time required per unit declines. As the labor time
declines, labor cost declines as well. This phenomenon is called the learning curve. To illustrate the
learning-curve concept, we explore its use by Cosmos Communications Technology (CCT ), a Cana-
dian manufacturer of sophisticated communications satellites in Vancouver, British Columbia. CCT’s
management has found that the learning curve applies to the labor-intensive assembly operation for
each new satellite design.

AFTER COMPLETING THIS CHAPTER, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
1 Explain the relationships between cost estimation, cost behavior, and cost prediction.
2 Define and describe the behavior of the following types of costs: variable, step-variable,
fixed, step-fixed, semivariable (or mixed), and curvilinear.
3 Explain the importance of the relevant range in using a cost behavior pattern for
cost prediction.
4 Define and give examples of engineered costs, committed costs, and discretionary
costs.
5 Describe and use the following cost estimation methods: account classification,
visual fit, high-low, and least-squares regression.
6 Describe the multiple regression, engineering, and learning-curve approaches to
cost estimation.
7 Describe some problems often encountered in collecting data for cost estimation.
8 Perform and interpret a least-squares regression analysis with a single
independent variable (appendix).
Managers in almost any organization want to know how costs will be affected by changes in
the organization’s activity. The relationship between cost and activity, called cost behavior,
is relevant to the management functions of planning, control, and decision making. In order
to p lan operations and prepare a budget, managers at N abisco need to predict the costs that
will be incurred at different levels of production and sales. To control the costs of providing
commercial-loan services at Wachovia , executives need to have a feel for the costs that the
bank should incur at various levels of commercial-loan activity. In deciding whether to add
a new intensive care unit, a hospital’s administrators need to predict the cost of operating the
new unit at various levels of patient demand. In each of these situations, knowledge of c ost
behavior will help the manager to make the desired cost prediction. A c ost prediction is a
forecast of cost at a particular level of activity. In the first half of this chapter, we will study
cost behavior patterns and their use in making cost predictions.
How does a managerial accountant determine the cost behavior pattern for a particu-

Chapter 6 Activity Analysis, Cost Behavior, and Cost Estimation 235
Cost Behavior Patterns
Our discussion of cost behavior patterns, also called c ost functions, will be set in the con- TASTY
text of a donut shop business. Tasty Donuts, Inc. operates a chain of 10 donut shops in the D NUTS
city of Toronto, Ontario. Each shop sells a variety of donuts, muffins, and sweet rolls as
well as various beverages. Beverages, such as coffee and fruit juices, are prepared in each
donut shop, but all of the company’s donuts and baked products are made in a centrally
located bakery. The company leases several small delivery trucks to transport the bakery
items to its donut shops. Use of a central bakery is more cost-efficient. Moreover, this
approach allows the firm to smooth out fluctuations in demand for each type of product.
For example, the demand for glazed donuts may change from day to day in each donut
shop, but these fluctuations tend to cancel each other out when the total demand is aggre-
gated across all 10 shops.
The corporate controller for Tasty Donuts has recently completed a study of the com-
pany’s cost behavior to use in preparing the firm’s budget for the coming year. The con-
troller studied the following costs.
Direct material: ingredients for donuts, muffins, and sweet rolls; beverages; paper
products, such as napkins and disposable cups.
Direct labor: wages and fringe benefits of bakers, donut shop sales personnel, and
delivery-truck drivers.
Overhead:
Facilities costs: property taxes; depreciation on bakery building, donut shops, and
equipment; salaries and fringe benefits of maintenance personnel. “Failure to understand costs

activity in terms of dozens of bakery items sold. Thus, dozens of bakery items sold is the Accenture,
cost driver for each of the costs studied. A bakery item is one donut, muffin, or sweet regarding its client Portugal
roll. The costs to make each of these products are nearly identical. The number of bakery Telecom
items sold each day is roughly the same as the number produced, since bakery goods are
produced to keep pace with demand as reported by the company’s donut shop managers.
Variable Costs
Variable costs were discussed briefly in Chapter 2. We will summarize that discussion
Learning Objective 2
here in the context of the Tasty Donuts illustration. A variable cost changes in total
in direct proportion to a change in the activity level (or cost driver). Tasty Donuts’ Define and describe the
direct-material cost is a variable cost. As the company sells more donuts, muffins, behavior of the following types
and sweet rolls, the total cost of the ingredients for these goods increases in direct of costs: variable, step-variable,
proportion to the number of items sold. Moreover, the quantities of beverages sold fixed, step-fixed, semivariable
and paper products used by customers also increase in direct proportion to the number (or mixed), and curvilinear.
of bakery items sold. As a result, the costs of beverages and paper products are also
variable costs.
Panel A of Exhibit 6–1 displays a graph of Tasty Donuts’ direct-material cost. As the
graph shows, t otal variable cost increases in proportion to the activity level (or cost driver).
When activity triples, for example, from 50,000 dozen items to 150,000 dozen items, total
direct-material costs triple, from $55,000 to $165,000. However, the variable cost per unit
remains the same as activity changes. The total direct-material cost incurred p er dozen
items sold is constant at $1.10 per dozen. The table in panel B of Exhibit 6–1 illustrates this

point. The variable cost per unit also is represented in the graph in panel A of Exhibit 6–1
as the slope of the cost line.
To summarize, as activity changes, total variable cost increases in direct proportion
to the change in activity level, but the variable cost per unit remains constant.
Step-Variable Costs
Some costs are nearly variable, but they increase in small steps instead of continuously.
Such costs, called s tep-variable costs, usually include inputs that are purchased and
used in relatively small increments. At Tasty Donuts, Inc., the direct-labor cost of bak-
ers, counter-service personnel, and delivery-truck drivers is a step-variable cost. Many
of these employees are part-time workers, called upon for relatively small increments
of time, such as a few hours. On a typical day, for example, Tasty Donuts may have 35
employees at work in the bakery and the donut shops. If activity increases slightly, these
employees can handle the extra work. However, if activity increases substantially, the
bakery manager or various restaurant managers may call on additional help. Exhibit 6–2 ,
a graph of Tasty Donuts’ monthly direct-labor cost, shows that this cost remains constant
within an activity range of about 5,000 dozen bakery items per month. When monthly
activity increases beyond this narrow range, direct-labor costs increase.
Approximating a Step-Variable Cost If the steps in a step-variable cost
behavior pattern are small, the step-variable cost function may be approximated by a
variable cost function without much loss in accuracy. Exhibit 6–3 shows such an approxi-
mation for Tasty Donuts’ direct-labor cost.

Fixed Costs
Fixed costs were covered briefly in Chapter 2. We will summarize that discussion here,
using the Tasty Donuts illustration. A f ixed cost remains unchanged in total as the activ-
ity level (or cost driver) varies. Facilities costs, which include property taxes, deprecia-
tion on buildings and equipment, and the salaries of maintenance personnel, are fixed
costs for Tasty Donuts, Inc. These fixed costs are graphed in panel A of Exhibit 6–4 . This
graph shows that the t otal monthly cost of property taxes, depreciation, and maintenance
personnel is $200,000 regardless of how many dozen bakery items are produced and sold
during the month.
The fixed cost p er unit does change as activity varies. Exhibit 6–4 (panel B) shows
that the company’s facilities cost per dozen bakery items is $4.00 when 50,000 dozen
items are produced and sold. However, this unit cost declines to $2.00 when 100,000
dozen items are produced and sold. If activity increases to 150,000 dozen items, unit
fixed cost will decline further, to about $1.33.
A graph provides another way of viewing the change in unit fixed cost as activity
changes. Panel C of Exhibit 6–4 displays a graph of Tasty Donuts’ cost of property taxes,
depreciation, and maintenance personnel p er dozen bakery items. As the graph shows, the
fixed cost per dozen bakery items declines steadily as activity increases. “By understanding the

As Exhibit 6–5 shows, for activity in the range of 50,000 to 100,000 dozen bakery
items per month, Tasty Donuts’ monthly indirect-labor cost is $35,000. For this range of
activity, the company employs a full-time manager and a full-time assistant manager in
the bakery and in each donut shop. When monthly activity exceeds this range during the
summer tourist season, the company employs additional part-time assistant managers in
the bakery and in its busiest donut shops. The company hires college students who are
majoring in restaurant management for these summer positions. Their salaries boost the
monthly indirect-labor cost to $45,000. Tasty Donuts has not experienced demand of less
than 50,000 dozen bakery items per month. However, the controller anticipates that if

such a decrease in demand were to occur, the company would reduce the daily operating
hours for its donut shops. This would allow the firm to operate each donut shop with only
a full-time manager and no assistant manager. As the graph in Exhibit 6–5 indicates, such
a decrease in managerial personnel would reduce monthly indirect-labor cost to $25,000.
Semivariable Cost
A semivariable (or m ixed ) cost has both a fixed and a variable component. The cost of
operating delivery trucks is a semivariable cost for Tasty Donuts, Inc. These costs are
graphed in Exhibit 6–6 . As the graph shows, the company’s delivery-truck costs have
two components. The fixed-cost component is $3,000 per month, which is the monthly
rental payment paid under the lease contract for the delivery trucks. The monthly rental
payment is constant, regardless of the level of activity (or cost driver). The variable-cost

component consists of the costs of gasoline, oil, routine maintenance, and tires. These
costs vary with activity, since greater activity levels result in more deliveries. The dis-
tance between the fixed-cost line (dashed line) and the total-cost line in Exhibit 6–6 is the
amount of variable cost. For example, at an activity level of 100,000 dozen bakery items,
the total variable-cost component is $10,000.
The slope of the total-cost line is the variable cost per unit of activity. For Tasty Donuts,
the variable cost of operating its delivery trucks is $.10 per dozen bakery items sold.
Curvilinear Cost
The graphs of all of the cost behavior patterns examined so far consist of either straight
lines or several straight-line sections. A curvilinear cost behavior pattern has a curved
graph. Tasty Donuts’ utilities cost, depicted as the s olid curve in Exhibit 6–7 , is a curvi-
linear cost. For low levels of activity, this cost exhibits d ecreasing marginal costs. As the
discussion in Chapter 2 indicated, a marginal cost is the cost of producing the next unit,
in this case the next dozen bakery items. As the graph in Exhibit 6–7 shows, the marginal
utilities cost of producing the next dozen bakery items declines as activity increases in
the range zero to 100,000 dozen items per month. For activity greater than 100,000 dozen
bakery items per month, the graph in Exhibit 6–7 exhibits i ncreasing marginal costs.
Tasty Donuts’ utilities cost includes electricity, telephone, and trash-collection costs.
The utilities cost is curvilinear as a result of the company’s pattern of electricity usage in
the bakery. If the demand in a particular month is less than 100,000 dozen bakery items,
the goods can be produced entirely in the modernized section of the bakery. This section

uses recently purchased deep-fat fryers and ovens that are very energy-efficient. As long
as the bakery operates only the modernized section, the utilities cost per dozen items
declines as production increases.
During the summer tourist months, when Tasty Donuts’ sales exceed 100,000 dozen
items per month, the older section of the bakery also must be used. This section uses
much older cooking equipment that is less energy-efficient. As a result, the marginal
utilities cost per dozen bakery items rises as monthly activity increases in the range above
100,000 dozen items per month.
Relevant Range The cost behavior graphed in Exhibit 6–7 is very different at low

activity levels (below 50,000) than it is at high activity levels (above 125,000). However,
management need not concern itself with these extreme levels of activity if it is unlikely Explain the importance of
that Tasty Donuts, Inc. will operate at those activity levels. Management is interested in the relevant range in using a

firm’s relevant range to be 75,000 to 120,000 dozen bakery items per month. Based on
past experience and sales projections, management does not expect the firm to oper-
ate outside that range of monthly activity. Tasty Donuts’ relevant range is shown in
Exhibit 6–7 as the section of the graph between the dashed lines.

range. However, as the activity level gets further away from the boundary of the relevant Ford Motor Company
range, the approximation declines in accuracy. For monthly activity levels of 25,000 or
150,000, for example, the approximation is very poor.
The straight, dashed line used to approximate Tasty Donuts’ utilities cost w ithin the
relevant range represents a semivariable cost behavior pattern. This straight-line graph
has a slope of $.05, which represents a unit variable-cost component of $.05 per dozen
bakery items. The line intersects the vertical axis of the graph at $1,500, which represents
a fixed-cost component of $1,500 per month. Managerial accountants often use a
semivariable-cost behavior pattern to approximate a curvilinear cost. However, it is impor-
tant to limit this approximation to the range of activity in which its accuracy is acceptable.
Using Cost Behavior Patterns to Predict Costs
How can Tasty Donuts’ corporate controller use the cost behavior patterns identified in
the cost study to help in the budgeting process? First, a sales forecast is made for each
month during the budget year. Suppose management expects Tasty Donuts’ activity level
to be 110,000 dozen bakery items during the month of June. Second, a cost prediction is
made for each of the firm’s cost items. The following cost predictions are based on the
cost behavior patterns discussed earlier. (Try to verify these cost predictions by referring
to the graphs in Exhibits 6–1 through 6–7 .)

M anagement
A ccounting IS DIRECT LABOR A VARIABLE OR A FIXED COST?
P ractice BusinessWeek recently published an article titled “The Disposable Worker,” which
explains “how companies are making the era of the ‘temp’ more than temporary.” This
Nestlé, Lincoln Electric,
raises the question: Are direct-labor costs variable or fixed? The answer, as with many
and Hilton Hotels
questions, is “it depends.” What it depends on is the ability and willingness of a com-
pany’s management to continually fine-tune the size of its workforce. If labor contracts
make it difficult to lay off workers during an economic downturn, or if top management
adopts a policy of maintaining a stable workforce, direct-labor costs will tend to be largely
fixed (or step-fixed). However, if management can and is willing to reduce the labor force
when activity declines, then labor cost will be a variable (or step-variable) cost.
The current trend in many companies seems to be toward adjusting the workforce to
conform to current needs. Here are several cases in point.
Nestlé
“Nestlé’s prepared foods unit has built an in-house roster of part-time workers in Chero-
kee County, South Carolina, who stick by the telephone to hear if they should report on
a given day to assemble frozen chicken dinners. The county job-placement office sends
Nestlé lists of ‘call-ins’: people available to work when Nestlé phones them. The workers
usually get a day’s notice. Some agree to stay by the phone in the morning, in case the
company is short for the afternoon shift. They typically work two to six days a week and
earn slightly more than $11 an hour, which is considered good part-time pay in the area.”
The head of human resources for the prepared-foods division says demand for its
Lean Cuisine glazed-chicken entrees and Stouffers creamed-spinach side dishes is fairly
steady. The company still hires some people full time. But the Nestlé executive says it is
still hard to predict labor needs, because schedules for producing certain meals vary, and
each product requires a different number of people to make. “ ‘We don’t need the same
number of people every day,’ he says. ‘They work as we need them.’ ” 1
Lincoln Electric
“In Cleveland, Lincoln Electric Co. shifts salaried workers to hourly clerical jobs, pay-
ing them a different wage for each assignment. The Cleveland-based manufacturer of
welding and cutting parts says that, for nearly 60 years, it has guaranteed long-term
employment for all of its workers who have worked steadily for three years in its U.S.
operations. The flip side is that employees have to be willing to change their job assign-
ments, depending on the type and volume of orders Lincoln receives.2
Hilton Hotels
“Many employers, wary of losing valued workers altogether, are reducing the workweek
rather than the workforce. Officials of Hilton Hotels Corp. in Beverly Hills, California, boast
that they have laid off relatively few workers. However, Hilton says workweek reductions
are widespread among its 77,000 workers.” 3
By relying more on part-time workers and daily call-ins, cross-training and frequently
moving employees to new jobs, and shortening the workweek, Nestlé, Lincoln Electric,
and Hilton Hotels are moving toward direct-labor costs that are much more variable than
in the past. Other companies trending toward a “just-in-time workforce” are Walmart,
Taco Bell, Starbucks, and U-Haul, among others. This is “all part of the larger development in
corporate America of transforming labor from a fixed to a more flexible cost.” 4

Chapter 6 Activity Analysis, Cost Behavior, and Cost Estimation 243
The preparation of a complete budget involves much more analysis and detailed
planning than is shown here.5 The point is that cost prediction is an important part of the
planning process. The cost behavior patterns discussed in this chapter make those cost
predictions possible.
Engineered, Committed, and Discretionary Costs
In the process of budgeting costs, it is often useful for management to make a distinction

A committed cost results from an organization’s ownership or use of facilities and
its basic organization structure. Property taxes, depreciation on buildings and equipment,
costs of renting facilities or equipment, and the salaries of management personnel are
examples of committed fixed costs. Tasty Donuts’ facilities cost is a committed fixed cost.
A discretionary cost arises as a result of a management decision to spend a particular
amount of money for some purpose. Examples of discretionary costs include amounts
spent on research and development, advertising and promotion, management develop-
ment programs, and contributions to charitable organizations. For example, suppose Tasty
Donuts’ management decided to spend $12,400 each month on promotion and advertising.
The distinction between committed and discretionary costs is an important one. Man-
agement can change committed costs only through relatively major decisions that have long- “Cost information about

management can alter them over time. For example, the management of a manufacturing
firm may decide to spend $100,000 on research and development in the current year, but cut

usually semivariable or curvilinear costs. A semivariable-cost behavior pattern is gen-
Cornell University
erally used to approximate a curvilinear cost within the relevant range. Supervisory
salaries are usually step-fixed costs, since one person can supervise production over a
range of activity. When activity increases beyond that range, such as when a new shift
is added, an additional supervisor is added.
In merchandising firms, such as Borders, the activity base (or cost driver) usually is
sales revenue. The cost of merchandise sold is a variable cost. Most labor costs are fixed
or step-fixed costs, since a particular number of sales and stock personnel can generally
handle sales activity over a fairly wide range of sales. Store facility costs, such as rent,
depreciation on buildings and furnishings, and property taxes, are fixed costs.
In some industries, the choice of the cost driver is not obvious, and the cost behav-
ior pattern can depend on the cost driver selected. At S outhwest Airlines, for instance,
the cost driver could be air miles flown, passengers flown, or passenger miles flown.
A passenger mile is the transportation of one passenger for one mile. Fuel costs are
variable with respect to air miles traveled, but are not necessarily variable with respect
to passenger miles flown. An airplane uses more fuel in flying from New York to
Los Angeles than from New York to Chicago. However, a plane does not require sig-
nificantly more fuel to fly 200 people from one city to another than to fly 190 people
the same distance. In contrast, an airport landing fee is a fixed cost for a particular
number of aircraft arrivals, regardless of how far the planes have flown or how many
people were transported. The point of this discussion is that both the organization
and the cost driver are crucial determinants of the cost behavior for each cost item.
Conclusions drawn about cost behavior in one industry are not necessarily transfer-
able to another industry.
Cost Estimation
As the preceding discussion indicates, different costs exhibit a variety of cost behavior
patterns. Cost estimation is the process of determining how a particular cost behaves.
Several methods are commonly used to estimate the relationship between cost and activ-
ity. Some of these methods are simple, while some are quite sophisticated. In some
firms, managers use more than one method of cost estimation. The results of the dif-

ferent methods are then combined by the cost analyst on the basis of experience and

regression.
The a ccount-classification method of cost estimation, also called account analysis,
involves a careful examination of the organization’s ledger accounts. The cost analyst
classifies each cost item in the ledger as a variable, fixed, or semivariable cost. The
classification is based on the analyst’s knowledge of the organization’s activities and
hiL10912_ch06_232-273.indd 244 7/21/10 3:29 PM

Chapter 6 Activity Analysis, Cost Behavior, and Cost Estimation 245
experience with the organization’s costs. For example, it may be obvious to the analyst
going through the ledger that direct-material cost is variable, building depreciation is
fixed, and utility costs are semivariable.
Once the costs have been classified, the cost analyst estimates cost amounts by
examining job-cost records, paid bills, labor time cards, or other source documents. A
property-tax bill, for example, will provide the cost analyst with the information needed
to estimate this fixed cost. This examination of historical source documents is combined
with other knowledge that may affect costs in the future. For example, the municipal
government may have recently enacted a 10 percent property-tax increase, which takes
effect the following year.
For some costs, particularly those classified as semivariable, the cost analyst may
use one of several more systematic methods of incorporating historical data in the cost
estimate. These methods are discussed next.
Visual-Fit Method
When a cost has been classified as semivariable, or when the analyst has no clear idea
about the behavior of a cost item, it is helpful to use the visual-fit method to plot recent
observations of the cost at various activity levels. The resulting s catter diagram helps the
analyst visualize the relationship between cost and the level of activity (or cost driver). To
illustrate, suppose Tasty Donuts’ controller has compiled the following historical data for
the company’s utility costs.
Activity or Cost Driver
Utility Cost (dozens of bakery items
Month for Month sold per month)
January ...................................................... $5,100 .................................................... 75,000
February ..................................................... 5,300 .................................................... 78,000
March ........................................................ 5,650 .................................................... 80,000
April ........................................................... 6,300 .................................................... 92,000
May ........................................................... 6,400 .................................................... 98,000

October ...................................................... 6,100 .................................................... 90,000
November ................................................... 5,600 .................................................... 85,000
December .................................................. 5,900 .................................................... 90,000
The scatter diagram of these data is shown in Exhibit 6–8 . The cost analyst can v isu-
ally fit a line to these data by laying a ruler on the plotted points. The line is positioned
so that roughly equal numbers of plotted points lie above and below the line. Using this
method, Tasty Donuts’ controller visually fit the line shown in Exhibit 6–8 .
Just a glance at the visually fit cost line reveals that Tasty Donuts’ utilities cost is
a semivariable cost w ithin the relevant range. The scatter diagram provides little or no
information about the cost relationship outside the relevant range. Recall from the discus-
sion of Tasty Donuts’ utilities cost (see Exhibit 6–7 ) that the controller believes the cost
behavior pattern to be curvilinear over the e ntire range of activity. This judgment is based
on the controller’s knowledge of the firm’s facilities and an understanding of electricity
usage by the modern bakery equipment and the older bakery equipment. As Exhibit 6–7
shows, however, the curvilinear utilities cost can be approximated closely by a semivari-
able cost w ithin the relevant range. The data plotted in the scatter diagram lie within
the relevant range. Consequently, the data provide a sound basis for the semivariable
approximation that the controller has chosen to use.

The visually fit cost line in Exhibit 6–8 intercepts the vertical axis at $1,500. Thus,
$1,500 is the estimate of the fixed-cost component in the semivariable-cost approxima-
tion. To determine the variable cost per unit, subtract the fixed cost from the total cost
at any activity level. The remainder is the total variable cost for that activity level. For
example, the total variable cost for an activity level of 50,000 dozen items is $2,500 (total
cost of $4,000 minus fixed cost of $1,500). This yields a variable cost of $.05 per dozen
bakery items ($.05 ! $2,500 " 50,000).
These variable and fixed cost estimates were used for the semivariable-cost approx-
imation discussed earlier in the chapter ( Exhibit 6–7 ). These estimates are valid only
within the relevant range.
Evaluation of Visual-Fit Method The scatter diagram and visually fit cost line
provide a valuable first step in the analysis of any cost item suspected to be semivariable
or curvilinear. The method is easy to use and to explain to others, and it provides a useful
view of the overall cost behavior pattern.
The visual-fit method also enables an experienced cost analyst to spot o utliers in the
data. An o utlier is a data point that falls far away from the other points in the scatter dia-
gram and is not representative of the data. Suppose, for example, that the data point for
January had been $6,000 for 75,000 units of activity. Exhibit 6–8 reveals that such a data
point would be way out of line with the rest of the data. The cost analyst would follow up
on such a cost observation to discover the reasons behind it. It could be that the data point
is in error. Perhaps a utility bill was misread when the data were compiled, or possibly
the billing itself was in error. Another possibility is that the cost observation is correct
but due to unusual circumstances. Perhaps Toronto experienced a record cold wave dur-
ing January that required the company’s donut shops to use unusually high amounts of
electric heat. Perhaps an oven in the bakery had a broken thermostat during January that
caused the oven to overheat consistently until discovered and repaired. An outlier can
result from many causes. If the outlier is due to an error or very unusual circumstances,
the data point should be ignored in the cost analysis.
A significant drawback of the visual-fit method is its lack of objectivity. Two cost ana-
lysts may draw two different visually fit cost lines. This is not usually a serious problem, how-
ever, particularly if the visual-fit method is combined with other, more objective methods.

Chapter 6 Activity Analysis, Cost Behavior, and Cost Estimation 247
High-Low Method
In the high-low method, the semivariable-cost approximation is computed using exactly
two data points. The high and low a ctivity levels are chosen from the available data set.
These activity levels, together with their associated cost levels, are used to compute the
variable and fixed cost components as follows:
Difference between the costs corresponding
Variable cost per to the highest and lowest activity levels
! _________ _______ __ ________ _ ____ _____
dozen bakery items Difference between the highest
and lowest activity levels
$7,035 # $5,100 $1,935
! _ _______ _______ ! _ _____
118,000 # 75,000 43,000
! $.045 per dozen items
Now we can compute the total variable cost at either the high or low activity level. At the
low activity of 75,000 dozen items, the total variable cost is $3,375 ($.045 $ 75,000).
Subtracting the total variable cost from the total cost at the 75,000 dozen activity level,
we obtain the fixed-cost estimate of $1,725 ($5,100 # $3,375). Notice that the high and
low a ctivity levels are used to choose the two data points. In general, these two points
need not necessarily coincide with the high and low cost levels in the data set.
Exhibit 6–9 presents a graph of Tasty Donuts’ utilities cost, which is based on the
high-low method of cost estimation. As in any cost estimation method, this estimate of
the cost behavior pattern should be r estricted to the relevant range.
Evaluation of High-Low Method The high-low method is more objective
than the visual-fit method, since it leaves no room for the cost analyst’s judgment. How-
ever, the high-low method suffers from a major weakness. Only two data points are used
to estimate the cost behavior pattern; the remainder of the data points are ignored. In
this regard, the visual-fit method is superior to the high-low method, since the former
approach uses all of the available data.

248 Chapter 6 Activity Analysis, Cost Behavior, and Cost Estimation
Least-Squares Regression Method
Statistical techniques may be used to estimate objectively a cost behavior pattern using
all of the available data. The most common of these methods is called least-squares
regression. To understand this method, examine Exhibit 6–10 , which repeats the scatter
diagram of Tasty Donuts’ utilities cost data. The Exhibit also includes a cost line that
has been drawn through the plotted data points. Since the data points do not lie along a
perfectly straight line, any cost line drawn through this scatter diagram will miss some or
most of the data points. The objective is to draw the cost line so as to make the deviations
between the cost line and the data points as small as possible.
In the l east-squares regression method, the cost line is positioned so as to minimize
the sum of the squared deviations between the cost line and the data points. The inset to
Exhibit 6–10 depicts this technique graphically. Note that the deviations between the cost
line and the data points are measured vertically on the graph rather than perpendicular
to the line. The cost line fit to the data using least-squares regression is called a least-
squares regression line (or simply a r egression line ) .

Equation Form of Least-Squares Regression Line The least-squares
regression line shown in Exhibit 6–10 may be represented by the equation of a straight
line. In the following equation, X denotes Tasty Donuts’ activity level for a month, and
Y denotes the estimated utilities cost for that level of activity. The intercept of the line
on the vertical axis is denoted by a, and the slope of the line is denoted by b . Within the
relevant range, a is interpreted as an estimate of the fixed-cost component, and b is inter-
preted as an estimate of the variable cost per unit of activity.
Y ! a % bX (1)
In regression analysis, X is referred to as the independent variable, since it is the vari-
able upon which the estimate is based. Y is called the d ependent variable, since its esti-
mate depends on the independent variable.
The least-squares regression line for Tasty Donuts’ utilities cost is shown below in
equation form.
Y ! 1,920 % .0448X

cost for one month for one month
Within the relevant range of activity, the regression estimate of the fixed-cost compo-
nent is $1,920 per month, and the regression estimate of the variable-cost component is
$.0448 per dozen bakery items.
There are several statistical software packages available that do regression analysis.
However, a common method of computing the least-squares regression estimates is to
use a spreadsheet application such as Microsoft® Excel. This approach is covered in this
chapter’s appendix, which you may want to read now.
Evaluation of Least-Squares Regression Method We have seen that
least-squares regression is an objective method of cost estimation that makes use of all
available data. Moreover, the regression line has desirable statistical properties for mak-
ing cost predictions and drawing inferences about the relationship between cost and
activity. The method does require considerably more computation than either the visual-
fit or high-low method. However, computer programs are readily available to perform
least-squares regression.
Evaluating a Particular Least-Squares Regression Line We have seen
the benefits of least-squares regression in general. How does a cost analyst evaluate a
particular regression line based on a specific set of data? A number of criteria may be
used, including e conomic plausibility and g oodness of fit.
The cost analyst should always evaluate a regression line from the perspective
of e conomic plausibility. Does the regression line make economic sense? Is it intui-
tively plausible to the cost analyst? If not, the analyst should reconsider using the
regression line to make cost predictions. It may be that the chosen independent vari-
able is not a good predictor of the cost behavior being analyzed. Perhaps another
independent variable should be considered. Alternatively, there may be errors in the
data upon which the regression is based. Rechecking the data will resolve this issue.
It could be that fundamental assumptions that underlie the regression method have
been violated. In this case, the analyst may have to resort to some other method of
cost estimation.
Another criterion commonly used to evaluate a particular regression line is to assess
its g oodness of fit. Statistical methods can be used to determine objectively how well a
regression line fits the data upon which it is based. If a regression line fits the data well,
a large proportion of the variation in the dependent variable will be explained by the

variation in the independent variable. One frequently used measure of goodness of fit is
described in the appendix at the end of this chapter.6
Multiple Regression

cost estimation. To illustrate, we will continue our analysis of Tasty Donuts’ utilities costs. The com-
pany uses electricity for two primary purposes: operating cooking equipment, such as
deep-fat fryers and ovens, and heating the bakery and donut shops. The cost of electricity
for food production is a function of the firm’s activity, as measured in dozens of bakery
items produced and sold. However, the cost of electricity for donut shop heating is related
more closely to the number of customers than to the number of bakery items sold. A
donut shop’s heating costs go up each time the shop’s door is opened, resulting in loss of
heat. Two customers purchasing half a dozen donuts each result in greater heating cost
than one customer buying a dozen donuts.
Suppose Tasty Donuts’ controller wants to estimate a cost behavior pattern for utili-
ties cost that is based on both units of sales and number of customers. The method of
multiple regression may be used for this purpose. Multiple regression is a statistical
method that estimates a linear (straight-line) relationship between one dependent variable
and two or more independent variables. In Tasty Donuts’ case, the following regression
equation would be estimated.
Y ! a % b X % b X (2)

served. The multiple-regression equation will likely enable Tasty Donuts’ controller to
make more accurate cost predictions than could be made with the s imple regression dis-
cussed previously. A s imple regression is based on a single independent variable. Mul-
tiple regression is covered more extensively in cost accounting and statistics texts.
Data Collection Problems
Regardless of the method used, the resulting cost estimation will be only as good as

the data upon which it is based. The collection of data appropriate for cost estimation
Describe some problems often requires a skilled and experienced cost analyst. Six problems frequently complicate the
encountered in collecting data process of data collection:
for cost estimation.
1. M issing data. Misplaced source documents or failure to record a transaction
can result in missing data.
2. O utliers. We have discussed these extreme observations of cost-activity rela-
tionships. If outliers are determined to represent errors or highly unusual cir-
cumstances, they should be eliminated from the data set.
3. Mismatched time periods. The units of time for which the dependent and
independent variables are measured may not match. For example, production

of the least-squares regression method, see any statistics text.

Chapter 6 Activity Analysis, Cost Behavior, and Cost Estimation 251
activity may be recorded daily, but costs may be recorded monthly. A common
solution is to aggregate the production data to get monthly totals.
4. Trade-offs in choosing the time period. In choosing the length of the time
period for which data are collected, there are conflicting objectives. One objec-
tive is to obtain as many data points as possible, which implies a short time
period. Another objective is to choose a long enough time period to ensure that
the accounting system has accurately associated costs with time periods. If, for
example, a cost that resulted from production activity in one period is recorded
in a later period, the cost and activity data will not be matched properly. Longer
time periods result in fewer recording lags in the data.
5. Allocated and discretionary costs. Fixed costs are often a llocated on a per-
unit-of-activity basis. For example, fixed manufacturing-overhead costs such
as depreciation are allocated to units of production. As a result, such costs may
appear to be variable in the cost records. D iscretionary costs often are budgeted
in a manner that makes them appear variable. A cost such as advertising, for
example, may be fixed once management decides on the level of advertising.
If management’s policy is to budget advertising on the basis of sales dollars,
however, the cost will appear to be variable to the cost analyst. An experienced
analyst will be wary of such costs and take steps to learn how their amounts are
determined.
6. Inflation. During periods of inflation, historical cost data may not reflect future
cost behavior. One solution is to choose historical data from a period of low
inflation and then factor in the current inflation rate. Other, more sophisticated
approaches are also available, and they are covered in cost accounting texts.
Engineering Method of Cost Estimation
All of the methods of cost estimation examined so far are based on historical data.
Learning Objective 6
Each method estimates the relationship between cost and activity by studying the rela-
tionship observed in the past. A completely different method of cost estimation is to Describe the multiple
study the process that results in cost incurrence. This approach is called the engineer- regression, engineering, and
ing method of cost estimation. In a manufacturing firm, for example, a detailed study learning-curve approaches to

process. Rather than asking what the cost of material was last period, the engineering
approach is to ask how much material should be needed and how much it should cost.
Industrial engineers sometimes perform t ime and motion studies, which determine the
steps required for people to perform the manual tasks that are part of the production
process. Cost behavior patterns for various types of costs are then estimated on the
basis of the engineering analysis. Engineering cost studies are time-consuming and
expensive, but they often provide highly accurate estimates of cost behavior. More-
over, in rapidly evolving, high-technology industries, there may not be any historical
data on which to base cost estimates. Such industries as genetic engineering, super-
conductivity, and electronics are evolving so rapidly that historical data are often irrel-
evant in estimating costs.
Effect of Learning on Cost Behavior
In many production processes, production efficiency increases with experience. As
cumulative production output increases, the average labor time required per unit declines.
As the labor time declines, labor cost declines as well. This phenomenon is called
the l earning curve. First documented by aeronautical engineer P. T. Wright in the 1930s,
the learning curve concept was popularized by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG)
in the 1970s. BCG broadened the learning curve idea to include costs other than direct
labor and named this phenomenon the experience curve. The learning-curve and

252 Chapter 6 Activity Analysis, Cost Behavior, and Cost Estimation
experience-curve concepts have been applied primarily to complex, labor-intensive man-
ufacturing operations, such as aircraft assembly and shipbuilding. B oeing and A irbus ,
for example, make extensive use of the learning and experience curve concepts when
budgeting the cost for a new aircraft design. However, the learning curve also has seen
limited application in the health care services industry, mainly focusing on complex sur-
gical procedures.
To illustrate the learning curve concept, let’s explore its use by Cosmos Communi-
cations Technology (CCT), a Canadian manufacturer of sophisticated communications
satellites in Vancouver, British Columbia. The company’s satellites transmit voice and
data communications around the world. CCT’s management has found that the learning
curve applies to the labor-intensive assembly operation for each new satellite design. A
graphical portrayal of CCT’s learning curve is shown in panel A of Exhibit 6–11 . On this
learning curve, when cumulative output doubles, the average labor time per unit declines
by 20 percent. Panel B of Exhibit 6–11 displays the total labor time and average labor
time per unit for various levels of cumulative output. As cumulative output doubles from
5 to 10 units, for example, the average labor time per unit declines by 20 percent, from
100 hours per unit to 80 hours per unit. As CCT gains experience with a new satellite
design, estimates of the cost of direct labor should be adjusted downward to take this
learning effect into account.
When the learning-curve concept is applied to a broader set of costs than just labor
costs, it is referred to as an experience curve. Suppose, for example, that all labor and
variable overhead costs are observed to decline by 20 percent every time cumulative out-
put doubles. Then we would change the vertical axis of Exhibit 6–11 to labor and vari-
able overhead costs. The graph would then be called an e xperience curve.

Chapter Summary
LO1 Explain the relationships between cost estimation, cost behavior, and cost prediction. Cost
behavior is the relationship between cost and activity. Cost estimation refers to the determination of a
cost’s behavior. A cost prediction is a forecast of a cost at a particular level of activity.
LO2 Define and describe the behavior of the following types of costs: variable, step-variable,
fixed, step-fixed, semivariable (or mixed), and curvilinear. A variable cost changes in total in direct
proportion to a change in the activity level (or cost driver). A step-variable cost is nearly variable, but
increases in small steps instead of continuously. A fixed cost remains unchanged in total as the activity
level (or cost driver) varies. A step-fixed cost remains constant over a wide range of activity but jumps
to a different amount for activity levels outside that range. A semivariable (or mixed) cost has both a
variable and a semivariable component. A curvilinear cost behavior pattern has a curved graph.
LO3 Explain the importance of the relevant range in using a cost behavior pattern for cost
prediction. Cost predictions should be confined to the relevant range, which is the range of activ-
ity expected for the organization. If the organization operates at an activity level outside the relevant
range, any cost predictions based on data from the relevant range may not be very accurate.
LO4 Define and give examples of engineered costs, committed costs, and discretionary costs.
An engineered cost bears a definitive physical relationship to the activity measure. Direct material cost
is an example. A committed cost results from an organization’s ownership or use of facilities and its

basic organization structure. Examples include property taxes and depreciation on buildings and equip-
ment. A discretionary cost arises as a result of a management decision to spend a particular amount of
money for some purpose. Examples include research and development, advertising, and promotion.
LO5 Describe and use the following cost-estimation methods: account classification, visual fit,
high-low, and least-squares regression. The account-classification, visual-fit, high-low, and least-
squares regression methods of cost estimation are all based on an analysis of historical cost data observed
at a variety of activity levels. The account-classification method involves a careful examination of an
organization’s ledger accounts. In the visual-fit method, a cost analyst plots recent observations of cost
at various activity levels. In the high-low method, a semivariable cost is estimated using only two data
points: the high and the low activity levels. In the least-squares regression method, the cost line is esti-
mated so as to minimize the sum of the squared deviations between the cost line and the data points.
LO6 Describe the multiple regression, engineering, and learning-curve approaches to cost esti-
mation. Multiple regression is a statistical method that estimates a linear (straight-line) relationship
between one dependent variable and two or more independent variables. The engineering method of
cost estimation is based on a detailed analysis of the process that results in cost incurrence. Under the
learning-curve approach, the labor cost is estimated by studying the relationship between the cumulative
production quantity and the average labor time required per unit. When this approach is applied to costs
other than labor, it is referred to as the experience-curve approach.
LO7 Describe some problems often encountered in collecting data for cost estimation. Some com-
mon data collection problems include missing data, outliers (highly unusual observations), mismatched
time periods, and cost inflation. Allocated and discretionary costs create other challenges in data collec-
tion and cost estimation.
LO8 Perform and interpret a least-squares regression analysis with a single independent variable
(Appendix). In the least-squares regression method, the cost line is estimated so as to minimize the sum of
the squared deviations between the cost line and the data points. The resulting regression line has an intercept
on the vertical (cost) axis and a slope, which measures how steeply the cost line rises as activity increases.

APPENDIX TO CHAPTER 6
Least-Squares Regression
Using Microsoft ® Excel
TASTY T he least-squares regression line, which is shown below in equation form, includes two estimates.
D NUTS These estimates, which are called parameters, are the intercept (denoted by a ) and the s lope coefficient
(denoted by b ).
Y ! a # bX (3)
where X denotes the independent variable (activity level for one month)
Y denotes the dependent variable (cost for one month)
Statistical theorists have shown that these parameters are defined by the following two equations. 7

variable (Appendix). n(% X 2 ) & (%X )(%X )
where n denotes the number of data points
% denotes summation; for example, % Y denotes the sum of the Y (cost) values in the data
Calculating the intercept (a) and the slope coefficient (b) would be very laborious to do manually.
Fortunately, there are many statistical software programs available to do the regression calculations.
Alternatively, Microsoft® Excel can calculate the regression estimates, as the next section demonstrates.
Using Microsoft ® Excel to Calculate the Regression Parameters
A cost analyst can use commands in Microsoft® Excel to easily calculate the regression estimate for the
intercept (a ) and the slope (b ). All the analyst needs to do is input the data in a spreadsheet. The spread-
sheet in E xhibit 6–12 displays the data used to compute Tasty Donuts’ utilities cost. The dependent
variable (utilities cost) is in column B, and the independent variable (activity) is in column C. Then the
Excel functions INTERCEPT and SLOPE are used to compute the parameters. To use each command,
the analyst specifies the range of cells in the spreadsheet in which the values of the dependent variable
reside and the range of cells in which the values of the independent variable reside. This is illustrated in
the Excel worksheet in Exhibit 6–12 as follows:
Cell B24 contains the following formula: ! INTERCEPT(B7:B18,C7:C18)
Cell B25 contains the following formula: ! SLOPE(B7:B18,C7:C18)
In these formulas, B7:B18 specifies the range of cells where the values of the dependent variable reside,
and C7:C18 specifies the range of cells where the values of the independent variable reside.
As the Excel calculations show in Exhibit 6–12 , the regression estimates are as follows:
Intercept: a ! 1,920
Slope: b ! .0448
So the regression equation is the following:
Y ! 1,920 # .0448X
Es tim ate d uti liti es Ac tiv it y lev el
cost for one month for one month
7 The derivation of these equations, which requires calculus, is covered in any introductory statistics text.

Chapter 6 Activity Analysis, Cost Behavior, and Cost Estimation 257
Goodness of Fit
The goodness of fit for Tasty Donuts’ regression line may be measured by the c oefficient of deter-
mination, commonly denoted by R2 . This measure is defined as the percentage of the variability of the
dependent variable about its mean that is explained by the variability of the independent variable about
its mean. The higher the R2 , the better the regression line fits the data. The interpretation for a high R 2
is that the independent variable is a good predictor of the behavior of the dependent variable. In cost
estimation, a high R 2 means that the cost analyst can be relatively confident in the cost predictions based
on the estimated cost behavior pattern.
Statistical theorists have shown that R 2 can be computed using the following formula:
&(Y # Y’ )2
R2 ! 1 # _ ______ _ _ _ _ (6)
&(Y # Y )2
where Y denotes the observed value of the dependent variable (cost) at a particular activity level
Y ’ denotes the predicted value of the dependent variable (cost), based on the regression
line, at a particular activity level
_
Y denotes the mean (average) observation of the dependent variable (cost)
Excel can be used once again to calculate the R 2 . The analyst simply uses the RSQ command in
Excel. As shown in cell B26 of the Excel worksheet in Exhibit 6–12 , the R 2 is .949.
Cell B26 contains the following formula: ! RSQ(B7:B18,C7:C18)
This is a high value for R 2 , and Tasty Donuts’ controller may be quite confident in the resulting cost
predictions. As always, these predictions should be confined to the relevant range.

1. The cost of food varies in proportion to the number of patient days of activity. In January, the hos-
pital provided 3,000 patient days of care, and food costs amounted to $24,000.
2. The cost of salaries and fringe benefits for the administrative staff totals $12,000 per month.
3. The hospital’s laboratory costs include two components: (a ) $40,000 per month for compensation
of personnel and depreciation on equipment and (b ) $10 per patient day for chemicals and other
materials used in performing the tests.
4. The cost of utilities depends on how many wards the hospital needs to use during a particular
month. During months with activity under 2,000 patient days of care, two wards are used, resulting
in utility costs of $10,000. During months with greater than 2,000 patient days of care, three wards
are used, and utility costs total $15,000.

5. Many of the hospital’s nurses are part-time employees. As a result, the hours of nursing care pro-
vided can be easily adjusted to the amount required at any particular time. The cost of wages and
fringe benefits for nurses is approximately $2,500 for each block of 200 patient days of care pro-
vided during a month. For example, nursing costs total $2,500 for 1 to 200 patient days, $5,000 for
201 to 400 patient days, $7,500 for 401 to 600 patient days, and so forth.

March’s costs consisted of machine supplies ($102,000), depreciation ($15,000), and plant maintenance
($469,000). These costs exhibit the following respective behavior: variable, fixed, and semivariable.
The manufacturing overhead figures presented in the preceding table do not include Metcalf’s
supervisory labor cost, which is step-fixed in nature. For volume levels of less than 15,000 hours, super-
visory labor amounts to $45,000. The cost is $90,000 from 15,000–29,999 hours and $135,000 when
activity reaches 30,000 hours or more.
Required:
1. Determine the machine supplies cost and depreciation for January.
2. Using the high-low method, analyze Metcalf’s plant maintenance cost and calculate the monthly
fixed portion and the variable cost per direct-labor hour.
3. Assume that present cost behavior patterns continue into the latter half of the year. Estimate
the t otal amount of manufacturing overhead the company can expect in November if 29,500
direct-labor hours are worked.
4. Briefly explain the difference between a fixed cost and a step-fixed cost.
5. Assume that a company has a step-fixed cost. Generally speaking, where on a step should the firm
attempt to operate if it desires to achieve a maximum return on its investment?

Shortly after being hired as an analyst with Global American Airlines, Kim Williams was asked to

prepare a report that focused on passenger ticketing cost. The airline writes most of its own tickets

(largely through reservations personnel), makes little use of travel agents, and has seen an ever-
(LO 2, 5)
increasing passenger interest in e-ticketing. (i.e., electronic reservations and tickets handled over
4. C: $1,567,000 the Internet).
After some discussion, Williams thought it would be beneficial to begin her report with an over-
view of three different cost estimation tools: scatter diagrams, least-squares regression, and the high-low
method. She would then present the results of her analysis of the past year’s monthly ticketing cost,
which was driven largely by the number of tickets written. These results would be presented in the form
of algebraic equations that were derived by the three tools just cited. The equations follow. (C denotes
ticketing cost, and PT denotes number of passenger tickets written.)
Scatter diagram: C ! $320,000 % $2.15PT
Least-squares regression: C ! $312,000 % $2.30PT
High-low method: C ! $295,000 % $2.55PT
Williams had analyzed data over the past 12 months and built equations on these data, purposely
including the slowest month of the year (February) and the busiest month (November) so that things
would “. . . tend to average out.” She observed that November was especially busy because of
Thanksgiving, passengers purchasing tickets for upcoming holiday travel in December, and the effects
of a strike by Delta Western Airlines, Global American’s chief competitor. The lengthy strike resulted in
many of Delta Western’s passengers being rerouted on Global American flights.
Required:
1. Prepare a bullet-point list suitable for use in Williams’s report that describes the features of scatter
diagrams, least-squares regression, and the high-low method. Determine which of the three tools
will typically produce the most accurate results.
2. Will the three cost estimation tools normally result in different equations? Why?
3. Assuming the use of least-squares regression, explain what the $312,000 and $2.30 figures
represent.
4. Assuming the use of a scatter diagram, predict the cost of an upcoming month when Global
American expects to write 580,000 tickets.
5. Did Williams err in constructing the equations on data of the past 12 months? Briefly explain.
6. Assume that over the next few years, more of Global American’s passengers will take advantage of
e-ticketing over the Internet. What will likely happen to the airline’s cost structure in terms of vari-
able and fixed cost incurred?

*The overtime premium is 50 percent of the direct-labor wage rate.
Cairns believes that overhead is affected by total monthly direct-labor hours. Cairns decided to
perform a least-squares regression of overhead (OH) on total direct-labor hours (DLH). The following
regression formula was obtained.
OH ! 26,200 % 9.25DLH
Required:
1. The overhead rate developed from the least-squares regression is different from Cairns’ prelimi-
nary estimate of $18 per direct-labor hour. Explain the difference in the two overhead rates.
2. Using the overhead formula that was derived from the least-squares regression, determine a total
variable-cost estimate for each 1,000 square feet of landscaping.
3. Cairns has been asked to submit a bid on a landscaping project for the city government consisting of
60,000 square feet. Cairns estimates that 40 percent of the direct-labor hours required for the project

will be on overtime. Calculate the incremental costs that should be included in any bid that Cairns
would submit on this project. Use the overhead formula derived from the least-squares regression.
4. Should management rely on the overhead formula derived from the least-squares regression as the
basis for the variable overhead component of its cost estimate? Explain your answer.
5. After attending a seminar on activity-based costing, Cairns decided to further analyze the compa-
ny’s activities and costs. She discovered that a more accurate portrayal of the firm’s cost behavior
could be achieved by dividing overhead into three separate pools, each with its own cost driver.
Separate regression equations were estimated for each of the cost pools, with the following results.
OH ! 10,000 % 4.10 DLH,
1
where D LH denotes direct-labor hours
OH ! 9,100 % 13.50 SFS,
2
where S FS denotes the number of square feet of turf seeded (in thousands)
OH ! 8,000 % 6.60 PL,
3
where P L denotes the number of individual plantings (e.g., trees and shrubs)
Assume that 5 direct-labor hours will be needed to landscape each 1,000 square feet, regardless of
the specific planting material used.
a. Suppose the landscaping project for the city will involve seeding all 60,000 square feet of turf
and planting 80 trees and shrubs. Calculate the incremental v ariable overhead cost that Cairns
should include in the bid.
b. Recompute the incremental variable overhead cost for the city’s landscaping project assuming
half of the 60,000-square-foot landscaping area will be seeded and there will be 250 individual
plantings. The plantings will cover the entire 60,000-square-foot area.
c. Briefly explain, using concepts from activity-based costing, why the incremental costs differ
in requirements (a ) and ( b ).

Mahoney continued to puzzle over the report. “Could you pull some data together, Megan, so we
can see how this cost behaves over a range of patient loads?”
“You’ll have it this afternoon,” McDonough responded. Later that morning, she gathered the

McDonough does not believe the first year’s widely fluctuating patient load will be experienced
again in the future. She has estimated that the clinic’s relevant range of monthly activity in the future
will be 600 to 1,200 patients.
Required:
1. Draw a scatter diagram of the clinic’s administrative costs during its first year of operation.
2. Visually fit a curvilinear cost line to the plotted data.
3. Mark the clinic’s relevant range of activity on the scatter diagram.
4. Visually fit a semivariable-cost line to approximate the curvilinear cost behavior pattern within the
clinic’s relevant range.
5. Estimate the fixed- and variable-cost components of the visually fit semivariable-cost line.
6. Use an equation to express the semivariable-cost approximation of the clinic’s administrative
costs.
7. What is your prediction of the clinic’s administrative cost during a month when 800 patients visit
the clinic? When 300 patients visit? Which one of your visually fit cost lines did you use to make
each of these predictions? Why?

4. After receiving the memo comparing the three cost estimates, Mahoney called McDonough to dis-
cuss the matter. The following exchange occurred.
Mahoney: “As you know, Megan, I was never in favor of this clinic. It’s going to be a drag on our
administrative staff, and we’d have been far better off keeping the pediatrics operation here
in the hospital.”
McDonough: “I was aware that you felt the clinic was a mistake. Of course, the board of trustees
had other issues to consider. I believe the board felt the clinic should be built to make pediat-
ric care more accessible to the economically depressed area on the other side of the city.”
Mahoney: “That’s true, but the board doesn’t realize how difficult it’s going to make life for us
here in the hospital. In any case, I called to tell you that when you and I report to the board
next week, I’m going to recommend that the clinic be shut down. I want you to support my
recommendation with one of your cost estimates showing that administrative costs will soar
at high activity levels.”
McDonough: “But that estimate was based on the high-low method. It’s not an appropriate
method for this situation.”
Mahoney: “It i s an estimate, Megan, and it’s based on a well-known estimation method. This is
just the ammunition I need to make the board see things my way.”
McDonough: “I don’t know, Jeff. I just don’t think I can go along with that.”
Mahoney: “Be a team player, Megan. I’ve got a meeting now. Got to run.”
That night McDonough called to discuss the matter with her best friend, you. What would you
advise her?

FOCUS COMPANY >>>
THIS CHAPTER’S FOCUS is on the Seattle Contemporary Theater.
This nonprofit enterprise was formed to
bring contemporary drama to the Seattle area. The theater
operates in a historic theater building owned by the city,
for which Seattle Contemporary Theater pays the city
a fixed monthly rental charge and a portion of the
price of each ticket sold. The theater must cover
its operating expenses with ticket revenue in
order to break even. Using the Seattle Contem-
porary Theater as an illustration, we will explore
a technique called cost-volume-profit (or CVP)
analysis, which the theater’s managing director
and business manager use to better understand
the relationships between the theater’s costs,
ticket sales volume, and revenue.

In contrast to the nonprofit, entertainment-service setting of the Seattle

by AccuTime Company. The management of this manufacturer of digital clocks uses CVP
analysis to better understand the relationships between the company’s costs, sales volume,
and profit. The company’s management also analyzes the firm’s cost structure, which refers
to the relative proportion of fixed and variable costs.

AFTER COMPLETING THIS CHAPTER, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
1 Compute a break-even point using the contribution-margin approach and the
equation approach.
2 Compute the contribution-margin ratio and use it to find the break-even point in
sales dollars.
3 Prepare a cost-volume-profit (CVP) graph and explain how it is used.
4 Apply CVP analysis to determine the effect on profit of changes in fixed expenses,
variable expenses, sales prices, and sales volume.
5 Compute the break-even point and prepare a profit-volume graph for a
multiproduct enterprise.
6 List and discuss the key assumptions of CVP analysis.
7 Prepare and interpret a contribution income statement.
8 Explain the role of cost structure and operating leverage in CVP relationships.
9 Understand the implications of activity-based costing for CVP analysis.
10 Be aware of the effects of advanced manufacturing technology on CVP
relationships.
11 Understand the effect of income taxes on CVP analysis (appendix).
What effect on profit can U nited Airlines expect if it adds a flight on the Chicago to
New York route? How will N BC ’s profit change if the ratings increase for its evening
news program? How many patient days of care must M assachusetts General Hospital
provide to break even for the year? What happens to this break-even patient load if the
hospital leases a new computerized system for patient records?
Each of these questions concerns the effects on costs and revenues when the orga-
nization’s activity changes. The analytical technique used by managerial accountants to
address these questions is called c ost-volume-profit analysis. Often called C VP analysis
for short, this technique summarizes the effects of changes in an organization’s v olume
of activity on its costs, revenue, and profit. Cost-volume-profit analysis can be extended
to cover the effects on profit of changes in selling prices, service fees, costs, income-tax
rates, and the organization’s mix of products or services. What will happen to profit, for
example, if the N ew York Yankees raise ticket prices for stadium seats? In short, CVP
analysis provides management with a comprehensive overview of the effects on revenue
and costs of all kinds of short-run financial changes.
Although the word profit appears in the term, cost-volume-profit analysis is not
confined to profit-seeking enterprises. Managers in nonprofit organizations also rou-
tinely use CVP analysis to examine the effects of activity and other short-run changes
on revenue and costs. For example, as the State of Florida gains approximately 1,000
people a day in population, the state’s political leaders must analyze the effects of this
change on sales-tax revenues and the cost of providing services, such as education,

transportation, and police protection. Managers at such diverse nonprofit institutions as
Massachusetts General Hospital, Stanford University , and the U nited Way all use CVP
analysis as a routine operational tool.
Illustration of Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis
To illustrate the various analytical techniques used in cost-volume-profit analysis, we
will focus on a performing arts organization. The Seattle Contemporary Theater was
recently formed as a nonprofit enterprise to bring contemporary drama to the Seattle area.
The organization has a part-time, unpaid board of trustees comprising local professional
people who are avid theater fans. The board has hired the following full-time employees.

performances in a historic theater owned by the city. The theater has not been used for Abbott Laboratories
30 years, but the city has agreed to refurbish it and to provide lighting and sound equip-
ment. In return, the city will receive a rental charge of $10,000 per month plus $8 for each
theater ticket sold.
Projected Expenses and Revenue
The theater’s business manager and producer, Andrew Lloyd, has made the following
projections for the first few years of operation.
Fixed expenses per month:
Theater rental ............................................................................................................................................. $10,000

How could we compute Seattle Contemporary Theater’s break-even point if we did
not already know it is 8,000 tickets per month? This is the question to which we turn our
attention next.
Whether running a small business or a worldwide enterprise, understanding cost-volume-profit relationships is crucial in
managing any organization.

Chapter 7 Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis 279
Contribution-Margin Approach
Seattle Contemporary Theater will break even when the organization’s revenue from
ticket sales is equal to its expenses. How many tickets must be sold during one month
(one play’s run) for the organization to break even?
Each ticket sells for $16, but $10 of this is used to cover the variable expense per
ticket. This leaves $6 per ticket to c ontribute to covering the fixed expenses of $48,000.
When enough tickets have been sold in one month so that these $6 contributions per
ticket add up to $48,000, the organization will break even for the month. Thus, we may
compute the break-even volume of tickets as follows:
Fixed expenses $48,000

covering fixed expenses
Seattle Contemporary Theater must sell 8,000 tickets during a play’s one-month run to
break even for the month.
The $6 amount that remains of each ticket’s price, after the variable expenses are
covered, is called the unit contribution margin. The general formula for computing the
break-even sales volume in units is given below.

The contribution-margin and equation approaches are two equivalent techniques for
finding the break-even point. Both methods reach the same conclusion, and so personal
preference dictates which approach should be used.

range of activity within which management expects the theater to operate.
Step 1: Draw the axes of the graph. Label the vertical axis in dollars and the
horizontal axis in units of sales (tickets).
Step 2: Draw the fixed-expense line. It is parallel to the horizontal axis, since
fixed expenses do not change with activity.
Step 3: Compute total expense at any convenient volume. For example, select a
volume of 6,000 tickets.
Variable expenses (6,000 ! $10 per ticket) ........................................................................ $ 60,000
Fixed expenses .................................................................................................................. 48,000
Total expenses (at 6,000 tickets) ......................................................................................... $108,000
Plot this point ($108,000 at 6,000 tickets) on the graph. See point A on the

Profit and Loss Areas The CVP graph discloses more information than the break-
even calculation. From the graph, a manager can see the effects on profit of changes in
volume. The vertical distance between the lines on the graph represents the profit or loss
at a particular sales volume. If Seattle Contemporary Theater sells fewer than 8,000 tick-
ets in a month, the organization will suffer a loss. The magnitude of the loss increases
as ticket sales decline. The theater organization will have a profit if sales exceed 8,000
tickets in a month.
Implications of the Break-Even Point The position of the break-even point
within an organization’s relevant range of activity provides important informa-
tion to management. The Seattle Contemporary Theater building seats 450 people.
The agreement with the city of Seattle calls for 20 performances during each play’s

one-month run. Thus, the maximum number of tickets that can be sold each month is
9,000 (450 seats ! 20 performances). The organization’s break-even point is quite close
to the maximum possible sales volume. This could be cause for concern in a nonprofit
organization operating on limited resources.
What could management do to improve this situation? One possibility is to rene-
gotiate with the city to schedule additional performances. However, this might not be
feasible, because the actors need some rest each week. Also, additional performances
would likely entail additional costs, such as increased theater-rental expenses and
increased compensation for the actors and production crew. Other possible solutions
are to raise ticket prices or reduce costs. These kinds of issues will be explored later in
the chapter.
The CVP graph will not resolve this potential problem for the management of Seattle
Contemporary Theater. However, the graph will direct management’s attention to the
situation.
Alternative Format for the CVP Graph
An alternative format for the CVP graph, preferred by some managers, is displayed
in Exhibit 7–2 . The key difference is that fixed expenses are graphed above variable
expenses, instead of the reverse as they were in Exhibit 7–1 .
Profit-Volume Graph
Yet another approach to graphing cost-volume-profit relationships is displayed in
Exhibit 7–3 . This format is called a p rofit-volume graph, since it highlights the amount
of profit or loss. Notice that the graph intercepts the vertical axis at the amount equal
to fixed expenses at the zero activity level. The graph crosses the horizontal axis at the
break-even point. The vertical distance between the horizontal axis and the profit line, at
a particular level of sales volume, is the profit or loss at that volume.

and sales volume. ager and producer, to determine how many theater tickets must be sold during each play’s
one-month run to make a profit of $3,600.
The desired profit level of $3,600 is called a t arget net profit (o r income). The prob-
lem of computing the volume of sales required to earn a particular target net profit is very
similar to the problem of finding the break-even point. After all, the break-even point is
the number of units of sales required to earn a target net profit of zero.
Contribution-Margin Approach
Each ticket sold by Seattle Contemporary Theater has a unit contribution margin of $6
(sales price of $16 minus unit variable expense of $10). Eight thousand of these $6 con-
tributions will contribute just enough to cover fixed expenses of $48,000. E ach additional
ticket sold will contribute $6 toward profit. Thus, we can modify formula (1) given earlier
in the chapter as follows:
Fixed expenses $ Target net profit Number of sales units required
__________ __ _______ _ _____ ___ " (5)
Unit contribution margin to earn target net profit
$48,000 $ $3,600
________ _ ______ " 8,600 tickets
$6
If Seattle Contemporary Theater sells 8,600 tickets during each play’s one-month run, the
organization will make a monthly profit of $3,600 on its performances. This profit can be
used to fund the Seattle Drama Workshop. The total dollar sales required to earn a target
net profit is found by modifying formula (2) given previously.

Filling in the values for Seattle Contemporary Theater, we have the following equation.

where X d enotes the sales volume required to earn the target net profit.

Graphical Approach
The profit-volume graph in Exhibit 7–3 also can be used to find the sales volume required
to earn a target net profit. First, locate Seattle Contemporary Theater’s target net profit
of $3,600 on the vertical axis. Then move horizontally until the profit line is reached.
Finally, move down from the profit line to the horizontal axis to determine the required
sales volume.
Applying CVP Analysis

and sales volume.
The safety margin of an enterprise is the difference between the budgeted sales rev-
enue and the break-even sales revenue. Suppose Seattle Contemporary Theater’s business
manager expects every performance of each play to be sold out. Then budgeted monthly
sales revenue is $144,000 (450 seats ! 20 performances of each play ! $16 per ticket). “Basically the role of the

Changes in Fixed Expenses
Abbott Laboratories
What would happen to Seattle Contemporary Theater’s break-even point if fixed
expenses change? Suppose the business manager is concerned that the estimate for
fixed utilities expenses, $1,400 per month, is too low. What would happen to the break-
even point if fixed utilities expenses prove to be $2,600 instead? The break-even cal-
culations for both the original and the new estimate of fixed utilities expenses are as
follows:
Original Estimate New Estimate
Fixed utilities expenses ...................................................................................... $ 1,400 $ 2,600
Total fixed expenses .......................................................................................... $48,000 $ 49,200
Break-even calculation ...................................................................................... $48,000 $49,200

286 Chapter 7 Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis
The estimate of fixed expenses has increased by 2.5 percent, since $1,200 is
2.5 percent of $48,000. Notice that the break-even point also increased by 2.5 percent
(200 tickets is 2.5 percent of 8,000 tickets). This relationship will always exist.

Donations to Offset Fixed Expenses Nonprofit organizations often receive
cash donations from people or organizations desiring to support a worthy cause. A dona-
tion is equivalent to a reduction in fixed expenses, and it reduces the organization’s
break-even point. In our original set of data, Seattle Contemporary Theater’s monthly
fixed expenses total $48,000. Suppose that various people pledge donations amounting to
$6,000 per month. The new break-even point is computed as follows:
Fixed expenses # Donations

Changes in the Unit Contribution Margin
What would happen to Seattle Contemporary Theater’s break-even point if miscellaneous
variable expenses were $3 per ticket instead of $2? Alternatively, what would be the
effect of raising the ticket price to $18?
Change in Unit Variable Expenses If the theater organization’s miscella-
neous variable expenses increase from $2 to $3 per ticket, the unit contribution margin
will fall from $6 to $5. The original and new break-even points are computed as follows:
Original Estimate New Estimate
Miscellaneous variable expenses ......................................................................... $2 per ticket $3 per ticket
Unit contribution margin ...................................................................................... $6 $5
Break-even calculation ........................................................................................ $48,000 $48,000
(Fixed expenses % unit contribution margin) $6 $5
Break-even point (units) ....................................................................................... 8,000 tickets 9,600 tickets
Break-even point (dollars) .................................................................................... $128,000 $153,600
If this change in unit variable expenses actually occurs, it will no longer be possible
for the organization to break even. Only 9,000 tickets are available for each play’s one-
month run (450 seats ! 20 performances), but 9,600 tickets would have to be sold to
break even. Once again, CVP analysis will not solve this problem for management, but it
will direct management’s attention to potentially serious difficulties.
Change in Sales Price Changing the unit sales price will also alter the unit con-
tribution margin. Suppose the ticket price is raised from $16 to $18. This change will
raise the unit contribution margin from $6 to $8. The new break-even point will be 6,000
tickets ($48,000 % $8).
A $2 increase in the ticket price will lower the break-even point from 8,000 tickets
to 6,000 tickets. Is this change desirable? A lower break-even point decreases the risk of
operating with a loss if sales are sluggish. However, the organization may be more likely
to at least break even with a $16 ticket price than with an $18 ticket price. The reason is
that the lower ticket price encourages more people to attend the theater’s performances.

Chapter 7 Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis 287
It could be that break-even sales of 8,000 tickets at $16 are more likely than break-even
sales of 6,000 tickets at $18. Ultimately, the desirability of the ticket-price increase
depends on management’s assessment of the likely reaction by theater patrons.
Management’s decision about the ticket price increase also will reflect the funda-
mental goals of Seattle Contemporary Theater. This nonprofit drama organization was
formed to bring contemporary drama to the people of Seattle. The lower the ticket price,
the more accessible the theater’s productions will be to people of all income levels.
The point of this discussion is that CVP analysis provides valuable information, but
it is only one of several elements that influence management’s decisions.
Predicting Profit Given Expected Volume
So far, we have focused on finding the required sales volume to break even or achieve a
particular target net profit. Thus, we have asked the following question.
 Fix ed exp ens es 
Given:  U ni t co n t ribu tio n m arg in , Find: {required sales volume}

Target net profit
We also can use CVP analysis to turn this question around and make the following query.
 Fix ed exp ens es 

Given:  U ni t co n t ribu tio n m arg in , Find: {expected profit}

Expected sales volume
Suppose the management of Seattle Contemporary Theater expects fixed monthly
expenses of $48,000 and unit variable expenses of $10 per ticket. The organization’s
board of trustees is considering two different ticket prices, and the business manager has
forecast monthly demand at each price.
Ticket Price Forecast Monthly Demand
$16 ......................................................................................................................... 9,000
$20 ......................................................................................................................... 6,000
Expected profit may be calculated at each price as shown in the following table. In
these profit calculations, the t otal contribution margin is the difference between t otal
sales revenue and total variable expenses. This use of the term c ontribution margin is a
“total” concept rather than the “per unit” concept used earlier in the chapter. The total
contribution margin is the total amount left to contribute to covering fixed expenses after
total variable expenses have been covered.
Ticket Price
$16 $20
Sales revenue:
9,000 ! $16 ................................................................................................. $ 144,000
6,000 ! $20 ................................................................................................. $120,000
Less variable expenses:
9,000 ! $10 ................................................................................................. 90,000
6,000 ! $10 ................................................................................................. 60,000
Total contribution margin ..................................................................................... $ 54,000 $ 60,000
Less fixed expenses ............................................................................................ 48,000 48,000
Profit $ 6,000 $ 12,000
The difference in expected profit at the two ticket prices is due to two factors:
1. A different u nit contribution margin, defined previously as unit sales price
minus u nit variable expenses
2. A different sales volume

================================================================================

288 Chapter 7 Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis
Incremental Approach Rather than presenting the entire income statement under
each ticket price alternative, we can use a simpler incremental approach. This analysis
focuses only on the difference in the total contribution margin under the two prices. Thus,
the combined effect of the change in unit contribution margin and the change in sales
volume is as follows:
Expected total contribution margin at $20 ticket price:
6,000 ! ($20 # $10) ............................................................................................................................. $60,000
Expected total contribution margin at $16 ticket price:
9,000 ! ($16 # $10) ............................................................................................................................. 54,000
Difference in total contribution margin ........................................................................................................... $ 6,000
The $6,000 difference in expected profit, at the two ticket prices, is due to a $6,000
difference in the total contribution margin. The board of trustees will consider these pro-
jected profits as it decides which ticket price is best. Even though Seattle Contemporary
Theater is a nonprofit organization, it may still have legitimate reasons for attempting to
make a profit on its theater performances. For example, the board might use these profits
to fund a free drama workshop, provide scholarships for local young people to study
drama in college, or produce a free outdoor play for Seattle’s residents.
Interdependent Changes in Key Variables
Sometimes a change in one key variable will cause a change in another key variable.
Suppose the board of trustees is choosing between ticket prices of $16 and $20, and the
business manager has projected demand as shown in the preceding section. A famous
retired actress who lives in Seattle has offered to donate $10,000 per month to Seattle
Contemporary Theater if the board will set the ticket price at $16. The actress is inter-
ested in making the theater’s performances affordable for as many people as possible.
The facts are now as follows:
Unit Contribution Forecast Monthly Net Fixed Expenses
Ticket Price Margin Demand (after subtracting donation)
$16 ................ $ 6 .................. 9,000 ................ $38,000 ($48,000 # $10,000)
20 ............... 10 .................. 6,000 ................ 48,000
The organization’s expected profit at each price is computed as follows:
Ticket Price
$16 $20
Sales revenue:
9,000 ! $16 .............................................................................................................. $ 144,000
6,000 ! $20 .............................................................................................................. $120,000
Less variable expenses:
9,000 ! $10 .............................................................................................................. 90,000
6,000 ! $10 .............................................................................................................. 60,000
Total contribution margin .................................................................................................. $ 54,000 $ 60,000
Less net fixed expenses (net of donation) ........................................................................... 38,000 48,000
Profit ............................................................................................................................... $ 16,000 $ 12,000
Now the difference in expected profit at the two ticket prices is due to three factors:
1. A different u nit contribution margin.
2. A different sales volume.
3. A difference in the n et fixed expenses, after deducting the donation.

Chapter 7 Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis 289
Incremental Approach The combined effect of these factors is shown in the
following analysis, which focuses on the effects of the price alternatives on the total
contribution margin and the net fixed expenses.
Expected total contribution margin at $20 ticket price:
6,000 ! ($20 # $10) ............................................................................................................................... $ 60,000
Expected total contribution margin at $16 ticket price:
9,000 ! ($16 # $10) ............................................................................................................................... 54,000
Difference in total contribution margin ............................................................................................................. $ 6,000
(higher with $20 ticket price)
Net fixed expenses at $20 ticket price ............................................................................................................. $ 48,000
Net fixed expenses at $16 ticket price ............................................................................................................. 38,000
Difference in net fixed expenses (higher with $20 ticket price) .......................................................................... $10,000
The expected total contribution margin is $6,000 higher with the $20 ticket price, but
net fixed expenses are $10,000 higher. Thus, Seattle Contemporary Theater will make
$4,000 more in profit at the $16 price ($10,000 # $6,000).
CVP Information in Published Annual Reports
Cost-volume-profit relationships are so important to understanding an organization’s
operations that some companies disclose CVP information in their published annual
reports. The following illustration is from the airline industry. 1 2

AIRLINES KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON BREAK-EVEN LOAD FACTORS A ccounting
Airlines generally disclose their systemwide break-even load factors in their annual P ractice
reports. British Airways, for example, listed its break-even load factor as 63.6 percent in a

recent annual report. The large airlines, like British Airways, usually fill a smaller percent-

low-fare, low-cost carrier . . . now operates more than 100 flights a day to 18 cities in nine
states.”1 Its load factor, or percentage of seats filled, is 76.1 percent.
“A ir France has been able to make up for cutting Dallas and Miami flights with more
flights and larger planes to African cities. The airline has also expanded its service to
many French-speaking former destinations in the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean.
Together with Africa, the former colonies should account for almost the same amount of
Air France’s revenue this year as North America, analysts say. Still, the operating costs of
flying to Africa are 50 percent higher for Air France than flying to the U.S., and the logisti-
cal problems are much more challenging.”
In recent years, “ Sabena lost at least 8 percent on its flights to the U.S., but had
margins above 10 percent on routes to its former colonies Congo, Rwanda, and Burundi,
according to an internal Sabena study. That kind of difference in profit margins is com-
mon. Across the busy North Atlantic, where competition and seasonal variation force
heavy discounting, all airlines are lucky to break even with a plane 75 percent full. For
Kinshasa and other parts of Africa, where traffic is steadier, European carriers can break
even with their planes barely 60 percent full, and planes often fly 85 percent full.” 2

the historic theater building. Each box has five seats, which are more comfortable and
afford a better view of the stage than the theater’s general seating. The board of trustees
has decided to charge $16 per ticket for general seating and $20 per ticket for box seats.
These facts are summarized as follows:
Unit Seats Available
Unit Variable Contribution Seats in per Month
Seat Type Ticket Price Expense Margin Theater (20 performances)
Regular $16 $10 $ 6 450 9,000
Box 20 10 10 50 1,000
Notice that 90 percent of the available seats are regular seats, and 10 percent are box
seats. The business manager estimates that tickets for each type of seat will be sold in
the same proportion as the number of seats available. If, for example, 5,000 tickets are
sold during a month, sales will be as follows:
Regular seats: 90% ! 5,000 ................................................................................................................... 4,500
Box seats: 10% ! 5,000 ................................................................................................................... 500
Total .......................................................................................................................................... 5,000
For any organization selling multiple products, the relative proportion of each type of
product s old is called the s ales mix. The business manager’s estimate of Seattle Contem-
porary Theater’s s ales mix is 90 percent regular seats and 10 percent box seats.
The sales mix is an important assumption in multiproduct CVP analysis. The sales mix
is used to compute a w eighted-average unit contribution margin. This is the a verage
of the several products’ u nit contribution margins, weighted by the relative sales propor-
tion of each product. Seattle Contemporary Theater’s weighted-average unit contribution
margin is computed below.

Chapter 7 Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis 291
The break-even point of 7,500 tickets must be interpreted in light of the sales mix.
Seattle Contemporary Theater will break even for the month if it sells 7,500 tickets as
follows:
Break-even  Regular seats: 7,500 ! 90% ....................................................................................... 6,750 tickets
sales in  Box seats: 7,500 ! 10% ....................................................................................... 750 tickets
units  Total ............................................................................................................................ 7,500 tickets
The following income calculation verifies the break-even point.
Sales revenue:
Regular seats: 6,750 ! $16 .................................................................................................................... $108,000
Box seats: 750 ! $20 .................................................................................................................... 15,000
Total revenue: 7,500 seats in total ............................................................................................................ $123,000

Total contribution margin .............................................................................................................................. $ 48,000

are sold in any other mix of regular and box seats, the organization will not break even.
Notice that break-even formula (8) is a modification of formula (1) given earlier in
the chapter. The only difference is that formula (8) uses the w eighted-average unit con-
tribution margin.
Seattle Contemporary Theater’s business manager has constructed the profit-volume
graph in E xhibit 7–4. The PV graph shows the organization’s profit at any level of total
monthly sales, assuming the sales mix of 90 percent regular seats and 10 percent box
seats. For example, if 9,000 tickets are sold in total, at the assumed sales mix, the PV
graph indicates that profit will be $9,600.

292 Chapter 7 Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis
With multiproduct CVP analysis, a managerial accountant can investigate the
impact on profit of changes in sales volume, prices, variable costs, fixed costs, or
the sales mix itself. For example, what would be the effect on Seattle Contemporary
Theater’s break-even point if the sales mix were 95 percent regular seats and 5 per-
cent box seats? With this sales mix, the weighted-average unit contribution margin is
computed as follows:
Weighted-average unit

The break-even point increases from 7,500 tickets to approximately 7,742 tickets as a
result of the lower proportion of expensive seats in the sales mix.

Assumptions Underlying CVP Analysis
For any cost-volume-profit analysis to be valid, the following important assumptions

price of the product or service will not change as sales volume varies within
the relevant range.
2. The behavior of total expenses is linear (straight-line) over the relevant range.
This implies the following more specific assumptions.
a. Expenses can be categorized as fixed, variable, or semivariable. T otal fixed
expenses remain constant as activity changes, and the u nit variable expense
remains unchanged as activity varies.
b. The efficiency and productivity of the production process and workers
remain constant.
3. In multiproduct organizations, the sales mix remains constant over the relevant
range.
4. In manufacturing firms, the inventory levels at the beginning and end of the
period are the same. This implies that the number of units produced during the
period equals the number of units sold.
Role of Computerized Planning Models
and Electronic Spreadsheets
Cost-volume-profit analysis is based on the four general assumptions listed above as well
as specific estimates of all the variables used in the analysis. Since these variables are
rarely known with certainty, it is helpful to run a CVP analysis many times with differ-
ent combinations of estimates. For example, Seattle Contemporary Theater’s business
manager might do the CVP analysis using different estimates for the ticket prices, sales
mix for regular and box seats, unit variable expenses, and fixed expenses. This approach
is called sensitivity analysis, since it provides the analyst with a feel for how sensitive
the analysis is to the estimates upon which it is based. The widespread availability of
personal computers and electronic spreadsheet software has made sensitivity analysis
relatively easy to do.

CVP Relationships and the Income Statement
The management functions of planning, control, and decision making all are facilitated
by an understanding of cost-volume-profit relationships. These relationships are impor-
tant enough to operating managers that some businesses prepare income statements in a
way that highlights CVP issues. Before we examine this new income-statement format,
we will review the more traditional income statement used in the preceding chapters.
Traditional Income Statement
An income statement for AccuTime Company, a manufacturer of digital clocks, is shown
in Exhibit 7–5 (panel A). During 20x1 the firm manufactured and sold 20,000 clocks at
a price of $25 each. This income statement is prepared in the traditional manner. C ost
of goods sold includes both variable and fixed manufacturing costs, as measured by
the firm’s product-costing system. The g ross margin is computed by subtracting cost
of goods sold from sales. Selling and administrative expenses are then subtracted; each
expense includes both variable and fixed costs. T he traditional income statement does not
disclose the breakdown of each expense into its variable and fixed components.
Contribution Income Statement
Many operating managers find the traditional income-statement format difficult to Learning Objective 7
use, because it does not separate variable and fixed expenses. Instead they prefer Prepare and interpret a contri-
the c ontribution income statement. A contribution income statement for AccuTime bution income statement.

================================================================================

294 Chapter 7 Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis
is shown in Exhibit 7–5 (panel B). T he contribution format highlights the distinc-
tion between variable and fixed expenses. The variable manufacturing cost of each
clock is $14, and the total fixed manufacturing cost is $100,000. On the contribution
income statement, all variable expenses are subtracted from sales to obtain the c on-
tribution margin. For AccuTime, $200,000 remains from total sales revenue, after all
variable costs have been covered, to contribute to covering fixed costs and making a
profit. All fixed costs are then subtracted from the contribution margin to obtain net
income.
Comparison of Traditional and Contribution
Income Statements
Operating managers frequently prefer the contribution income statement, because its
separation of fixed and variable expenses highlights cost-volume-profit relationships. It
is readily apparent from the contribution format statement how income will be affected
when sales volume changes by a given percentage. Suppose management projects that
sales volume in 20x2 will be 20 percent greater than in 20x1. No changes are anticipated
in the sales price, variable cost per unit, or fixed costs. Examination of the contribu-
tion income statement shows that if sales volume increases by 20 percent, the follow-
ing changes will occur. (Our discussion ignores income taxes, which are covered in the
appendix at the end of this chapter.)
Income Statement Item 20x1 Amount Change 20x2 Amount
Sales ............................................ $500,000 .......................... $100,000 ......................... $600,000

Notice that net income increases by the same amount as the increase in the contri-
bution margin. Moreover, the contribution margin changes in direct proportion to the
change in sales volume. These two facts enable us to calculate the increase in net income
using the following shortcut. Recall that the contribution-margin ratio is the percentage
of contribution margin to sales.

Comparison of Cost
Structures
The preceding analysis makes use of cost-volume-profit relationships that are dis-
closed in the contribution income statement. Such an analysis cannot be made with the
information presented in the traditional income statement.
Cost Structure and Operating Leverage
The cost structure of an organization is the relative proportion of its fixed and variable

costs. Cost structures differ widely among industries and among firms within an industry.
A company using a computer-integrated manufacturing system has a large investment in Explain the role of cost
plant and equipment, which results in a cost structure dominated by fixed costs. In con- structure and operating
trast, a home building contractor’s cost structure has a much higher proportion of variable leverage in CVP relationships.
costs. The highly automated manufacturing firm is capital-intensive, whereas the home
building contractor is labor-intensive.
An organization’s cost structure has a significant effect on the sensitivity of its profit
to changes in volume. A convenient way to portray a firm’s cost structure is shown in
the Excel spreadsheet in Exhibit 7–6 . 3 The data for AccuTime Company (company A)
comes from the firm’s 20x1 contribution income statement in Exhibit 7–5 . For com-
parison purposes, two other firms’ cost structures also are shown. Although these three
firms have the same sales revenue ($500,000) and net income ($50,000), they have very
different cost structures. Company B’s production process is largely manual, and its cost
structure is dominated by variable costs. It has a low contribution-margin ratio of only
20 percent. In contrast, company C employs a highly automated production process, and
its cost structure is dominated by fixed costs. The firm’s contribution-margin ratio is
90 percent. Company A falls between these two extremes with a contribution-margin
ratio of 40 percent.
Suppose sales revenue increases by 10 percent, or $50,000, in each company. The
resulting increase in each company’s profit is calculated in Exhibit 7–7 .
Notice that company B, with its high variable expenses and low contribution-margin
ratio, shows a relatively low percentage increase in profit. In contrast, the high fixed
expenses and large contribution-margin ratio of company C result in a relatively high
percentage increase in profit. Company A falls in between these two extremes.
To summarize, the greater the proportion of fixed costs in a firm’s cost struc-
ture, the greater the impact on profit will be from a given percentage change in sales
revenue.
3 This form of income statement, in which each item on the statement is expressed as a percentage of sales revenue,
is often called a c ommon-size income statement.

Operating Leverage
The extent to which an organization uses fixed costs in its cost structure is called operat-
ing leverage. The operating leverage is greatest in firms with a large proportion of fixed
costs, low proportion of variable costs, and the resulting high contribution-margin ratio.
Exhibit 7–6 shows that company B has low operating leverage, company C has high
operating leverage, and company A falls in between. To a physical scientist, leverage
refers to the ability of a small force to move a heavy weight. To the managerial accoun-
tant, operating leverage refers to the ability of the firm to generate an increase in net
income when sales revenue increases.
Measuring Operating Leverage The managerial accountant can measure a
firm’s operating leverage, a t a particular sales volume, using the o perating leverage
factor:
Contribution margin
Operating leverage factor " _________ __ ___ ___
Net income
Using the data in Exhibit 7–6 , the operating leverage factors of companies A, B, and C
are computed as follows:

Company B (high variable expenses) ....... $100,000 % $50,000 " 2
Company C (high fixed expenses) ............ $450,000 % $50,000 " 9
The operating leverage factor is a measure, at a particular level of sales, of the per-
centage impact on net income of a given p ercentage change in sales revenue. Multiply-
ing the p ercentage change in sales revenue by the operating leverage factor yields the
percentage change in net income.

re-examining Exhibit 7–7 .

Break-Even Point and Safety Margin A firm’s operating leverage also
affects its break-even point. Since a firm with relatively high operating leverage has pro-
portionally high fixed expenses, the firm’s break-even point will be relatively high. This
fact is illustrated using the data from Exhibit 7–6 .

The safety margin also is affected by a firm’s operating leverage. Suppose the bud-
geted sales revenue for each of the three companies is $500,000. Then the safety margin,

That’s up from only one, and all of them are profitable. “The leaders of the Web pack are

reason is operating leverage. That’s accounting-speak for a simple concept: Once you
invest enough to build a Web site and your basic operations, you don’t need to spend
much money as sales rise. After you cover your fixed costs, the expense of processing
each sale is so little that profits grow faster than revenues. That philosophy made for big
Internet losses early on.” The payoff, however, is at hand.
“Online travel agency Expedia Inc. is a textbook example of leverage in action.” In
one quarter alone, “Expedia doubled its sales, to $116 million. Yet its overhead, including
administrative and marketing costs, rose only 8 percent, to $63 million. One big reason is
that the company already had paid for the computing gear it needed to handle the higher
volume of ticket sales.”
Just a few years after the boom in e-commerce IPOs, “a clear pecking order of prof-
itability has emerged. The biggest moneymakers: online travel, software, and financial-
services firms.” Why did these online companies turn profitable first? “Because software,
financial services, and travel reservations are pure information products, without a physi-
cal widget to store or ship. Once overhead costs are covered, the expense in providing
the service to one more customer is close to zero. Online retailers are making slower,
yet tangible, progress toward profitability. What’s holding Amazon.com Inc. and other
e-tailers back is simple: Every time someone buys a book on Amazon, the company has
to buy a new copy from the publisher. The upshot is that Amazon’s gross margins are
around 26 percent, compared with 70 percent at Expedia.”
Every year, Web business writes a different story, “but now it’s past the point where
predictions of profitability are written in sand. Some Web businesses do work. The proof
is in the black ink.”4

Company C (high fixed expenses) ..................................... 500,000 444,444 55,556
To summarize, company C’s high fixed expenses result in a high break-even point
and low safety margin. Company B displays the opposite characteristics, and company A
falls in between the two extremes.
Labor-Intensive Production Processes versus Advanced Manufac-
turing Systems The effects of labor-intensive (manual) production processes and
highly automated, advanced manufacturing systems illustrated by companies A, B, and C
are typical. As Exhibit 7–8 shows, a movement toward an advanced manufacturing envi-
ronment often results in a higher break-even point, lower safety margin, and higher oper-
ating leverage. However, high-technology manufacturing systems generally have greater
throughput, thus allowing greater potential for profitability. Along with the increased
potential for profitability comes increased risk. In an economic recession, for example,
a highly automated company with high fixed costs will be less able to adapt to lower
consumer demand than will a firm with a more labor-intensive production process.
Cost Structure and Operating Leverage: A Cost-Benefit Issue
A firm’s cost structure plays an important role in determining its cost-volume-profit rela-
tionships. A company with proportionately high fixed costs has relatively high operat-
ing leverage. The result of high operating leverage is that the firm can generate a large
percentage increase in net income from a relatively small percentage increase in sales
revenue. On the other hand, a firm with high operating leverage has a relatively high
break-even point. This entails some risk to the firm.
The optimal cost structure for an organization involves a trade-off. Management
must weigh the benefits of high operating leverage against the risks of large committed
fixed costs and the associated high break-even point.

Kaiser Permanente was founded in 1945 to provide health care for workers at Henry P ractice

its own hospitals, marketing its own health insurance, and working with doctors in
the Permanente Medical Group, who practice exclusively for Kaiser. Such a vertical
integration allows Kaiser to control costs better than HMOs that contract with inde-
pendent doctors and hospitals. This strategy results in Kaiser’s cost structure being
dominated by fixed costs. Kaiser has to focus on maintaining membership growth
because of its high operating leverage. 5
CVP Analysis, Activity-Based Costing,

Traditional cost-volume-profit analysis focuses on the number of units sold as the only

cost and revenue driver. Sales revenue is assumed to be linear in units sold. Moreover,
costs are categorized as fixed or variable, with respect to the number of units sold, within Understand the implications of
the relevant range. This approach is consistent with traditional product-costing systems, activity-based costing for CVP
in which cost assignment is based on a single, volume-related cost driver. In CVP analy- analysis.
sis, as in product costing, the traditional approach can be misleading or provide less than
adequate information for various management purposes. An activity-based costing sys-
tem can provide a much more complete picture of cost-volume-profit relationships and
thus provide better information to managers.5
To illustrate the potential impact of activity-based costing on CVP analysis, we will
continue our discussion of AccuTime Company. The basic data underlying the contribu-

Alternatively, management may determine how many clocks must be sold to earn a target
net profit of $200,000, as the following calculation demonstrates:
Sales volume required to earn Fixed costs $ Target net profit
" _________ _ _______ _ _____ __
target net profit of $200,000 Unit contribution margin
$150,000 $ $200,000
" _________ __ _______ " 35,000 units

What do these questions have in common? They both focus on sales volume as the
sole revenue and cost driver. The CVP analysis depends on a distinction between costs
that are fixed and costs that are variable w ith respect to sales volume.
A Move Toward JIT and Flexible Manufacturing
Now let’s examine another question AccuTime’s management could face. Suppose man-
Learning Objective 10
agement is considering the installation of a flexible manufacturing system and a move
Be aware of the effects of toward just-in-time (JIT) production. A flexible manufacturing system uses highly auto-
advanced manufacturing mated material-handling and production equipment to manufacture a variety of similar
technology on CVP products. In the new production process, setups would be quicker and more frequent and
relationships. production runs would be smaller. Fewer inspections would be required, due to the total
quality control (TQC) philosophy that often accompanies JIT. Variable manufacturing
costs would be lower, due to savings in direct labor. Finally, general factory overhead costs
would increase, due to the greater depreciation charges on the new production equipment.
Suppose management wants to answer the same two questions addressed previ-
ously, under the assumption that the production process changes are adopted. To properly
address this issue, we need a much more detailed understanding of the impact of other,
non-volume-based cost drivers on AccuTime’s costs. This type of detail is the hallmark
of an activity-based costing system. Suppose AccuTime’s controller completes an ABC
analysis of the company’s 20x1 activity before the new equipment is installed. The results
are shown in Exhibit 7–9 .
There is a subtle but important point to realize about the cost behavior depicted in
Exhibit 7–9 . Setup, inspection, and material handling are listed as fixed costs. They are

other cost drivers, such as the number of setups, inspections, and hours of material han-
dling. This is the fundamental distinction between a traditional CVP analysis and an
activity-based costing CVP analysis. The traditional CVP analysis recognizes a single,
volume-based cost driver, namely, sales volume. The activity-based costing CVP analysis
recognizes multiple cost drivers. As a result, some costs viewed as fixed under the tradi-
tional analysis are considered variable (with respect to the appropriate cost drivers) under
the ABC approach.
Now let’s return to management’s decision regarding the installation of a flexible
manufacturing system and the adoption of the JIT and TQC philosophies. The activity-
based costing analysis of the proposed production technology is displayed in Exhibit 7–10 .
Due to the decreased use of direct labor, the unit variable manufacturing cost has declined
from $14 to $9, thus bringing the total unit variable cost down to $10. This results in an
increase in the unit contribution margin to $15. The installation of sophisticated new
manufacturing equipment has more than tripled general factory overhead, from $60,000
to $184,000. Under the proposed JIT approach, setups will be daily instead of weekly;
each setup will be quicker and less expensive. As a result of the emphasis on total quality
control, only one inspection per day will be necessary, instead of three as before. More-
over, each inspection will be less expensive. Finally, the amount of material-handling
activity will decline dramatically, although there will be a slight increase in the cost per
hour. This is due to the higher skill grade of labor required to operate the new automated
material-handling system.
Using the ABC data in Exhibit 7–10 , we can answer the two CVP questions posed by
management. If the new production technology is adopted, the following CVP computa-
tions will be appropriate.

Notice that AccuTime’s break-even point increased with the introduction of the
advanced manufacturing system (from 15,000 to 16,667 units). However, the number
of sales units required to earn a target net profit of $200,000 declined (from 35,000 to
30,000 units). These kinds of CVP changes are typical when firms install an advanced
manufacturing system. Typically, the cost structure of an advanced manufacturing envi-
ronment is characterized by a lower proportion of variable costs and a larger proportion
of costs that are fixed (with respect to sales volume).
ABC Provides a Richer Understanding of Cost Behavior and CVP
Relationships The point of this section is that activity-based costing provides a
richer description of a company’s cost behavior. AccuTime’s traditional costing system
treated setup, inspection, and material handling as fixed costs. However, the ABC analy-
sis showed that while these costs are largely fixed with respect to sales volume, they are
not fixed with respect to other appropriate cost drivers. In analyzing the cost-volume-
profit implications of the proposed changes in manufacturing technology, it was crucial
to have an understanding of how these costs would change with respect to such cost
drivers as the number of setups, number of quality-assurance inspections, and amount of
material-handling activity.
Just as ABC can improve an organization’s product-costing system, it also can facilitate
a deeper understanding of cost behavior and CVP relationships.
Chapter Summary
LO1 Compute a break-even point using the contribution-margin approach and the equation
approach. These two approaches result in the same general formula for computing the break-
even point (in units). Under the equation approach, the profit equation is specified as follows:
Sales revenue # Variable expenses # Fixed expenses " Profit. When this equation is manipulated,
the contribution-margin approach to the break-even point results, as follows: Break-even point
(in units) " Fixed expenses % Unit contribution margin.
LO2 Compute the contribution-margin ratio and use it to find the break-even point in sales
dollars. The contribution-margin ratio is defined as follows: Unit contribution margin % Unit sales price.
The break-even point (in sales dollars) can be computed as follows: Fixed expenses % Contribution-
margin ratio.
LO3 Prepare a cost-volume-profit (CVP) graph and explain how it is used. A cost-volume-profit
graph shows the break-even point (in sales dollars) as the intersection of the total revenue line and the

Chapter 7 Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis 303
total expense line. The graph can be used to help management understand how changes in the volume of
activity affect cost and profit.
LO4 Apply CVP analysis to determine the effect on profit of changes in fixed expenses, variable
expenses, sales prices, and sales volume. Management can use the break-even equation to predict
the effects on the break-even point of changes in any component of the equation, e.g., sales price, unit
variable cost, fixed cost, and so forth. Such prediction can help management in making a variety of
operational decisions.
LO5 Compute the break-even point and prepare a profit-volume graph for a multiproduct
enterprise. Break-even analysis in a multiproduct firm is accomplished by computing a weighted-
average contribution margin, which is based on the expected sales mix. The same break-even formulas
are used as in a single-product analysis, except that the unit contribution margin is replaced by the
weighted-average contribution margin. This analysis is limited by the assumption of a constant sales
mix across the range of total sales volume.
LO6 List and discuss the key assumptions of CVP analysis. CVP analysis involves several key
assumptions, which follow: (1) Total revenue is linear (i.e., a straight line) with respect to changes in the
volume of activity. (2) Total expense is linear (i.e., a straight line) with respect to changes in the volume
of activity. An implication of this assumption is that the efficiency and productivity of the production
process remains constant. (3) The sales mix remains constant over the relevant range. (4) The beginning
and ending inventory levels are the same in a manufacturing firm.
LO7 Prepare and interpret a contribution income statement. Cost-volume-profit relationships are
important enough to operating managers that some firms prepare a contribution income statement. This
income-statement format separates fixed and variable expenses and computes the aggregate contribution
margin. This statement format helps managers discern the effects on profit from changes in volume.
The contribution income statement also discloses an organization’s cost structure, which is the relative
proportion of its fixed and variable costs.
LO8 Explain the role of cost structure and operating leverage in CVP relationships. An organi-
zation’s cost structure is the relative proportions of its fixed and variable costs. The extent to which an
organization uses fixed costs in its cost structure is called operating leverage. Firms with high operating
leverage tend to have higher break-even points, other things being equal.
LO9 Understand the implications of activity-based costing for CVP analysis. Activity-based cost-
ing (ABC) provides a richer description of an organization’s cost behavior and CVP relationships than
is provided by a traditional costing system. An ABC cost-volume-profit analysis recognizes that some
costs that are fixed with respect to sales volume may not be fixed with respect to other important cost
drivers. In many cases, management can benefit substantially from such an improved understanding of
cost behavior and CVP relationships.
LO10 Be aware of the effects of advanced manufacturing technology on CVP relationships. Com-
panies with advanced manufacturing technology tend to have higher fixed costs, lower variable costs,
and higher break-even points.
LO11 Understand the effect of income taxes on CVP analysis (Appendix). When a firm is required
to pay taxes on income, it is important to distinguish between after-tax (AT) income and before-tax (BT)
income. AT income is equal to BT income minus income tax expense. Therefore, BT income is equal
to AT income % (1 # tax rate). The number of units of sales required to earn a specified AT income is
equal to (BT income $ fixed expenses) % unit contribution margin.

Rearranging this equation yields the following formula.
(After-tax net income) " (Before-tax income)(1 # t) (9)
To illustrate this formula, suppose AccuTime Company must pay income taxes of 40 percent of its
before-tax income. The company’s contribution income statement for 20x1 appears below.
Sales, 20,000 units at $25 each ..................................................................................................................... $500,000

*Variable cost per unit is $15: variable manufacturing cost of $14 plus variable selling and administrative costs of $1.
The requirement that companies pay income taxes affects their cost-volume-profit relationships. To
earn a particular after-tax net income will require greater before-tax income than if there were no tax.
For example, if AccuTime’s target after-tax net income were $30,000, the company would have to earn
before-tax income of $50,000. AccuTime’s income statement shows this relationship.
How much before-tax income must be earned in order to achieve a particular target after-tax net
income? Rearranging equation (9) above yields the following formula.
Target Target

If AccuTime Company’s target after-tax net income is $30,000, its target before-tax income is
calculated as follows:

Now we are in a position to compute the number of digital clocks that AccuTime must sell in order
to achieve a particular after-tax net income. We begin with the following before-tax income equation.
Sales # Variable expenses # Fixed expenses " Before-tax income
Now we use our formula for before-tax income.

where X denotes the number of units that must be sold to achieve the target after-tax net income.

In terms of sales revenue, AccuTime must achieve a sales volume of $500,000 (20,000 units

previously.
Notice in the calculations above that $10 is the unit contribution margin ($25 sales price minus $15
variable expense). Thus, the general formula illustrated above is the following:

Chapter 7 Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis 307
A cost-volume-profit graph for AccuTime Company is displayed in Exhibit 7–11 . As the graph
shows, 20,000 units must be sold to achieve $30,000 in after-tax net income. The company’s break-even
point is 15,000 units. The break-even point is not affected by income taxes, because at the break-even
point, there is no income.
Notice that AccuTime Company must sell 5,000 units b eyond the break-even point in order to
achieve after-tax net income of $30,000. Each unit sold beyond the break-even point contributes $10
toward before-tax income. However, of that $10 contribution margin, $4 will have to be paid in income
taxes. This leaves an a fter-tax contribution of $6 toward after-tax net income. Thus, selling 5,000 units
beyond the break-even point results in after-tax net income of $30,000 (5,000 units ! $6 after-tax
contribution per unit).

of the wages paid. A total of 400 hours of overtime is expected for the year; this will be divided
equally between the legal secretary and the clerk-receptionist positions. Overtime will be paid at
one and one-half times the regular wage, and the fringe benefit expense will apply to the full wage.
• Smith has located 6,000 square feet of suitable office space that rents for $28 per square foot
annually. Asssociated expenses will be $27,000 for property insurance and $37,000 for utilities.
• It will be necessary for the group to purchase malpractice insurance, which is expected to cost

Chapter 7 Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis 317
Management is considering the installation of new, highly automated manufacturing equipment that
would significantly alter the production process. In addition, management plans a move toward just-in-
time inventory and production management. If the new equipment is installed, setups will be quicker
and less expensive. Under the proposed JIT approach, there would be 300 setups per year at $50 per
setup. Since a total quality control program would accompany the move toward JIT, only 100 inspections
would be anticipated annually, at a cost of $45 each. After the installation of the new production system,
800 hours of engineering would be required at a cost of $28 per hour. General factory overhead would
increase to $166,100. However, the automated equipment would allow Jupiter to cut its unit variable cost
by 20 percent. Moreover, the more consistent product quality anticipated would allow management to
raise the price of electronic games to $26 per unit. (Ignore income taxes.)
Required:
1. Upon seeing the ABC analysis given in the problem, Jupiter’s vice president for manufacturing
exclaimed to the controller, “I thought you told me this $150,000 cost was fixed. These don’t look
like fixed costs at all. What you’re telling me now is that setup costs us $400 every time we set up
a production run. What gives?”
As Jupiter’s controller, write a short memo explaining to the vice president what is going on.
2. Compute Jupiter’s new break-even point if the proposed automated equipment is installed.
3. Determine how many units Jupiter will have to sell to show a profit of $140,000, assuming the new
technology is adopted.
4. If Jupiter adopts the new manufacturing technology, will its break-even point be higher or lower?
Will the number of sales units required to earn a profit of $140,000 be higher or lower? (Refer to
your answers for the first two requirements of the preceding problem.) Are the results in this case
consistent with what you would typically expect to find? Explain.
5. The decision as to whether to purchase the automated manufacturing equipment will be made by
Jupiter’s board of directors. In order to support the proposed acquisition, the vice president for
manufacturing asked the controller to prepare a report on the financial implications of the decision.
As part of the report, the vice president asked the controller to compute the new break-even point,
assuming the installation of the equipment. The controller complied, as in requirement (2) of this
problem.
When the vice president for manufacturing saw that the break-even point would increase, he
asked the controller to delete the break-even analysis from the report. What should the controller
do? Which ethical standards for managerial accountants are involved here?

Additional Information:
• Management estimates that closing the downtown store would result in a 10 percent decrease in

1. Calculate the increase or decrease in Thurber’s monthly operating income during 20x2 if the
downtown store is closed.
2. The management of Thurber Book Stores is considering a promotional campaign at the downtown

would be the effect of this promotional campaign on the company’s monthly operating income
during 20x2?
3. One-half of the downtown store’s dollar sales are from items sold at their variable cost to attract
customers to the store. Thurber’s management is considering the deletion of these items, a move
that would reduce the downtown store’s direct fixed expenses by 15 percent and result in the loss
of 20 percent of the remaining downtown store’s sales volume. This change would not affect the
mall store. What would be the effect on Thurber’s monthly operating income if the items sold at
their variable cost are eliminated?
4. Build a spreadsheet: Construct an Excel spreadsheet to solve all of the preceding requirements.

new territory to maintain the firm’s current net income? Assume that sales and costs will continue
as in 20x1 in the firm’s established territories.
5. Management is considering replacing its labor-intensive process with an automated production
system. This would result in an increase of $58,500 annually in fixed manufacturing costs. The
variable manufacturing costs would decrease by $25 per ton. Compute the new break-even volume
in tons and in sales dollars.
6. Ignore the facts presented in requirement (5). Assume that management estimates that the selling

THIS CHAPTER’S FOCUS COMPANY is Q uikmath.com, a manufacturer of
handheld calculators, pagers, and other electronic gadgetry. Quikmath specializes in the
school-age and college markets, and virtually all of its sales
are Web-based. In this chapter, we explore two product-
costing systems called absorption and variable costing.
Under absorption costing, all manufacturing costs, includ-
ing fixed manufacturing overhead, are assigned as product
costs and stored in inventory until the products are sold.
Under variable costing, fixed manufacturing overhead is
not included in inventory as a product cost. Instead, fixed
manufacturing overhead is treated as a period cost, and it
is expensed during the period in which it is incurred. The
choice between absorption and variable costing arises only
in manufacturing firms.

Absorption and Variable
Costing
IN CONTRAST >>>
In contrast to the absorption and variable costing systems discussed
in the first part of the chapter, we explore yet another product-costing method called
throughput costing. We continue our illustration with Quikmath.com to explain how this
product-costing method works. Throughput costing assigns only the unit-level spending
for direct costs as the cost of a product. A unit-level cost is one that is incurred every time a
unit is manufactured.

AFTER COMPLETING THIS CHAPTER, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
1 Explain the accounting treatment of fixed manufacturing overhead under
absorption and variable costing.
2 Prepare an income statement under absorption costing.
3 Prepare an income statement under variable costing.
4 Reconcile reported income under absorption and variable costing.
5 Explain the implications of absorption and variable costing for cost-volume-profit
analysis.
6 Evaluate absorption and variable costing.
7 Explain the rationale behind throughput costing.
8 Prepare an income statement under throughput costing.
Income is one of many important measures used to evaluate the performance of companies
and segments of companies. There are two commonly used methods for determining
product costs and reporting income in a manufacturing firm, depending on the account-
ing treatment of fixed manufacturing overhead. In this chapter, we will examine these
two income-reporting alternatives, called a bsorption costing and v ariable costing. In
addition, we will study a third alternative for product costing and income reporting,
which is called throughput costing.
Product Costs
In the product-costing systems we have studied so far, manufacturing overhead is
applied to Work-in-Process Inventory as a product cost along with direct material and
direct labor. When the manufactured goods are finished, these product costs flow from
Work-in-Process Inventory into Finished-Goods Inventory. Finally, during the account-
ing period when the goods are sold, the product costs flow from Finished-Goods Inven-
tory into Cost of Goods Sold, an expense account. The following diagram summarizes
this flow of costs.

Since the costs of production are stored in inventory accounts until the goods are
sold, these costs are said to be i nventoried costs.

ing overhead is applied to Work-in-Process Inventory as a product cost.
The distinction between absorption and variable costing is summarized in
Exhibit 8–1 . Notice that the distinction involves the timing with which fixed man-
ufacturing overhead becomes an expense. Eventually, fixed overhead is expensed
under both product-costing systems. Under variable costing, however, fixed over-
head is expensed immediately, as it is incurred. Under absorption costing, fixed
overhead is inventoried until the accounting period during which the manufactured
goods are sold.

fixed manufacturing overhead is subtracted as a lump-sum period expense at the bottom
of each year’s income statement.
Reconciling Income under Absorption and Variable Costing
Examination of Exhibit 8–3 reveals that the income reported under absorption and variable
Learning Objective 4
costing is sometimes different. Although income is the same for the two product-costing
methods in 20x0, it is different in 20x1 and 20x2. Let’s figure out why these results occur. Reconcile reported income
under absorption and variable
costing.
No Change in Inventory In 20x0 there is no change in inventory over the
course of the year. Beginning and ending inventory are the same, because actual produc-
tion and sales are the same. Think about the implications of the stable inventory level
for the treatment of fixed manufacturing overhead. On the variable-costing statement,
the $150,000 of fixed manufacturing overhead incurred during 20x0 is an expense in
20x0. Under absorption costing, however, fixed manufacturing overhead was applied to
production at the predetermined rate of $3 per unit. Since all of the units produced in
20x0 also were sold in 20x0, all of the fixed manufacturing-overhead cost flowed through
into Cost of Goods Sold. Thus, $150,000 of fixed manufacturing overhead was expensed
in 20x0 under absorption costing also.

The 20x0 column of Exhibit 8–4 reconciles the 20x0 net income reported under
absorption and variable costing. The reconciliation focuses on the two places in the
income statements where differences occur between absorption and variable costing.
The numbers in the left-hand margin of Exhibit 8–4 correspond to the numbers in the
left-hand margin of the income statements in Exhibit 8–3 .
Increase in Inventory In 20x1 inventory increased from zero on January 1 to
15,000 units on December 31. The increase in inventory was the result of production
exceeding sales. Under variable costing, the $150,000 of fixed overhead cost incurred
in 20x1 is expensed, just as it was in 20x0. Under absorption costing, however, only a
portion of the 20x1 fixed manufacturing overhead is expensed in 20x1. Since the fixed
overhead is inventoried under absorption costing, some of this cost r emains in inventory
at the end of 20x1.
The 20x1 column of Exhibit 8–4 reconciles the 20x1 net income reported under
absorption and variable costing. As before, the reconciliation focuses on the two places in
the income statements where differences occur between absorption and variable costing.
Decrease in Inventory In 20x2 inventory decreased from 15,000 units to zero.
“The operational managers’ Sales during the year exceeded production. As in 20x0 and 20x1, under variable costing,

A Shortcut to Reconciling Income When inventory increases or decreases
during the year, reported income differs under absorption and variable costing. This
results from the fixed overhead that is inventoried under absorption costing but expensed
immediately under variable costing. The following formula may be used to compute the
difference in the amount of fixed overhead expensed in a given time period under the two
product-costing methods.1

Length of Time Period The discrepancies between absorption-costing and variable-
costing income in Exhibit 8–3 occur because of the changes in inventory levels during 20x1
and 20x2. It is common for production and sales to differ over the course of a week, month,
or year. Therefore, the income measured for those time periods often will differ between
absorption and variable costing. This discrepancy is likely to be smaller over longer time
periods. Over the course of a decade, for example, Quikmath.com cannot sell much more
or less than it produces. Thus, the income amounts under the two product-costing methods,
when added together over a lengthy time period, will be approximately equal under absorp-
tion and variable costing.
Notice in Exhibit 8–3 that Quikmath.com ’s total income over the three-year period is
$225,000 under both absorption and variable costing. This results from the fact that the
company produced and sold the same total amount over the three-year period.
Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis

332 Chapter 8 Absorption and Variable Costing
Now return to Exhibit 8–3 and examine the 20x1 income statements under absorp-
tion and variable costing. In 20x1 Quikmath.com sold 35,000 units, the break-even vol-
ume. This fact is confirmed on the variable-costing income statement, since net income
is zero. On the absorption-costing income statement, however, the 20x1 net income is
$45,000. What has happened here?
The answer to this inconsistency lies in the different treatment of fixed manu-
facturing overhead under absorption and variable costing. Variable costing highlights
the separation between fixed and variable costs, as do cost-volume-profit analysis
and break-even calculations. Both of these techniques account for fixed manufactur-
ing overhead as a lump sum. In contrast, a bsorption costing is inconsistent with CVP
analysis, because fixed overhead is applied to goods as a product cost on a per-unit
basis.
Evaluation of Absorption and Variable Costing
Some managers find the inconsistency between absorption costing and CVP analysis
Learning Objective 6
troubling enough to warrant using variable costing for internal income reporting. Vari-
Evaluate absorption and able costing dovetails much more closely than absorption costing with any operational
variable costing. analyses that require a separation between fixed and variable costs.
Pricing Decisions Many managers prefer to use absorption-costing data in
cost-based pricing decisions. They argue that fixed manufacturing overhead is a necessary
cost incurred in the production process. To exclude this fixed cost from the invento-
ried cost of a product, as is done under variable costing, is to understate the cost of the
product. For this reason, most companies that use cost-based pricing base their prices on
absorption-costing data.
Proponents of variable costing argue that a product’s variable cost provides a better
basis for the pricing decision. They point out that any price above a product’s variable
cost makes a positive contribution to covering fixed cost and profit.
Definition of an Asset Another controversy about absorption and variable cost-
ing hinges on the definition of an asset. An a sset is a thing of value owned by the organi-
zation with future service potential. By accounting convention, assets are valued at their
cost. Since fixed costs comprise part of the cost of production, advocates of absorption
costing argue that inventory (an asset) should be valued at its full (absorption) cost of
production. Moreover, they argue that these costs have future service potential since the
inventory can be sold in the future to generate sales revenue.
Proponents of variable costing argue that the fixed-cost component of a prod-
uct’s absorption-costing value has no future service potential. Their reasoning is that
the fixed manufacturing-overhead costs during the current period will not prevent
these costs from having to be incurred again next period. Fixed-overhead costs will
be incurred every period, regardless of production levels. In contrast, the incurrence of
variable costs in manufacturing a product does allow the firm to avoid incurring these
costs again.
To illustrate, Quikmath.com produced 15,000 more calculators in 20x1 than it sold.
These units will be carried in inventory until they are sold in some future year. Quikmath.
com will never again have to incur the costs of direct material, direct labor, and variable
overhead incurred in 20x1 to produce those calculators. Yet Quikmath.com will have to
incur approximately $150,000 of fixed-overhead costs every year, even though the firm
has the 15,000 units from 20x1 in inventory.
External Reporting For external reporting purposes, generally accepted account-
ing principles require that income reporting be based on absorption costing. Federal tax
laws also require the use of absorption costing in reporting income for tax purposes.

IRS: UNIQUE PRODUCT PACKAGING IS AN INVENTORIABLE COST A ccounting
The Internal Revenue Service (I RS ) requires absorption costing for tax purposes. Thus, absorp- P ractice
tion costing must be used in valuing inventory and in determining cost-of-goods-sold
IRS
expense, which in turn affects taxable income. The IRS defines inventoriable costs
(i.e., product costs) that must be included in valuing inventory and cost-of-goods-sold
expense to include the following: (1) direct material consumed in the production of the
product and (2) direct labor, and (3) all indirect costs deemed to be necessary for the pro-
duction of the company’s product. These necessary indirect costs include fixed-overhead
costs. Thus, absorption costing is mandated by the IRS.
One interesting nuance in the IRS interpretation of what constitutes inventoriable
costs concerns a company’s expenditures on the design of the packaging for the com-
pany’s products. Packaging design costs can run into hundreds of thousands of dollars
for large consumer products companies. The IRS has specified that packaging design
costs must be inventoried as product costs if the resulting design is successful—that
is, it remains in use for several years. If, however, a package design fails in the mar-
ketplace, the company can deduct the package design costs early as an expense.
Examples of products with unique packaging designs that would be affected by this
IRS ruling include P ringles potato chips (sold in a can), Realemon and Realime (sold in
plastic citrus-fruit-shaped containers), and L ’eggs pantyhose (sold in the familiar plastic
egg-shaped containers).
Why Not Both? Using computerized accounting systems, it is straightforward
for a company to prepare income statements under both absorption and variable cost-
ing. Since absorption-costing statements are required for external reporting, managers
will want to keep an eye on the effects of their decisions on financial reports to outsid-
ers. Yet the superiority of variable-costing income reporting as a method for dovetailing
with operational analyses cannot be denied. Preparation of both absorption-costing and
variable-costing data is perhaps the best solution to the controversy.
JIT Manufacturing Environment In a just-in-time inventory and production
management system, all inventories are kept very low. Since finished-goods inventories
are minimal, there is little change in inventory from period to period. Thus, in a JIT envi-
ronment, the income differences under absorption and variable costing generally will be
insignificant.
Throughput Costing
Some managers advocate t hroughput costing as an alternative to either absorption or

as in the Excel spreadsheet shown in Exhibit 8–6 . Notice that all costs other than the

A comparison of the reported income under throughput costing ( Exhibit 8–6 )
with the reported income under either variable or absorption costing ( Exhibit 8–3 )
reveals substantial differences in the “bottom line” under the three methods for each
year. Proponents of throughput costing argue that this method alone eliminates the
incentive to produce excess inventory simply to reduce unit costs by spreading c om-
mitted resource costs (i.e., direct labor and variable and fixed manufacturing over-
head) across more units. The incentive for such overproduction disappears under
throughput costing, because all nonthroughput costs (direct labor and manufacturing
overhead in our illustration) will be expensed as period costs regardless of how many
units are produced.

Chapter Summary
LO1 Explain the accounting treatment of fixed manufacturing overhead under absorption and
variable costing. Under absorption (or full) costing, fixed overhead is applied to manufactured goods
as a product cost. The fixed-overhead cost remains in inventory until the goods are sold. Under variable
(or direct) costing, fixed overhead is a period cost expensed during the period when it is incurred.

336 Chapter 8 Absorption and Variable Costing
LO2 Prepare an income statement under absorption costing. On an absorption-costing income
statement, the cost of goods sold is measured at absorption cost (i.e., includes direct material, direct
labor, and both variable and fixed manufacturing overhead) and, therefore, fixed overhead is not a
period cost.
LO3 Prepare an income statement under variable costing. On a variable-costing income statement,
the cost of goods sold is measured at variable cost (i.e., includes direct material, direct labor, and only
variable manufacturing overhead), and fixed overhead is treated as a period cost.
LO4 Reconcile reported income under absorption and variable costing. Income reported under
absorption and variable costing can be reconciled by focusing on the effects of the two places where the
two statements differ: (1) calculation of cost of goods sold and (2) period costs.
LO5 Explain the implications of absorption and variable costing for cost-volume-profit analysis.
Variable costing highlights the separation between fixed and variable costs, as do cost-volume-profit
analysis and break-even calculations. Both of these techniques account for fixed manufacturing over-
head as a lump-sum period cost. In contrast, absorption costing is inconsistent with CVP analysis,
because fixed overhead is applied to goods as a product cost on a per-unit basis.
LO6 Evaluate absorption and variable costing. There are pros and cons to both costing methods.
Variable costing dovetails much more closely than absorption costing with any operational analysis that
requires a separation between fixed and variable costs (e.g., CVP analysis). On the other hand, variable
costing understates a product’s cost, because it excludes fixed manufacturing overhead from the unit
cost calculation. In contrast, absorption costing alleviates that objection by including fixed overhead on
a per-unit basis in a product’s cost. However, this distorts the cost behavior of fixed costs, which do not
in fact vary with production activity.
LO7 Explain the rationale behind throughput costing. Some accountants and managers advocate
throughput costing, in which only throughput costs are inventoried as product costs. They argue that
throughput costing reduces the incentive for management to produce excess inventory simply for the
purpose of spreading committed (non-throughput) costs across a larger number of units produced.
LO8 Prepare an income statement under throughput costing. A throughput-costing income state-
ment assigns only unit-level spending for direct costs as the cost of products or services. A unit-level cost
is incurred every time a unit is manufactured and will not be incurred if another unit is not manufactured.
All other costs are treated as period costs.

342 Chapter 8 Absorption and Variable Costing
The budgeted per-unit cost figures were based on Outback producing and selling 140,000 units
in 20x1. Outback uses a predetermined overhead rate for applying manufacturing overhead to its
product. A total manufacturing overhead rate of $9.00 per unit was employed for absorption costing
purposes in 20x1. Any overapplied or underapplied manufacturing overhead is closed to the Cost
of Goods Sold account at the end of the year. The 20x1 beginning finished-goods inventory for
absorption costing purposes was valued at the 20x0 budgeted unit manufacturing cost, which was
the same as the 20x1 budgeted unit manufacturing cost. There are no work-in-process inventories at
either the beginning or the end of the year. The planned and actual unit selling price for 20x1 was
$70 per unit.
Required: Was Outback’s 20x1 income higher under absorption costing or variable costing? Why?
Compute the following amounts.
1. The value of Outback Corporation’s 20x1 ending finished-goods inventory under absorption
costing.
2. The value of Outback Corporation’s 20x1 ending finished-goods inventory under variable
costing.
3. The difference between Outback Corporation’s 20x1 reported income calculated under absorption
costing and calculated under variable costing.
4. Suppose Outback Corporation had introduced a JIT production and inventory management system
at the beginning of 20x1.

uses a highly automated manufacturing process to produce its tents, cozycamp.com
and 75 percent of its sales are made through its Cozycamp.com Web site. In this chapter,
we will explore how Cozycamp.com goes about developing its annual budget. A budget
is a detailed plan, expressed in quantitative terms, that
specifies how resources will be acquired and used
during a specific period of time. Cozycamp

In contrast to the manufacturing setting of C ozycamp.com, we explore
budgeting at Philadelphia Fitness Cooperative. This service organiza-

ness club elect a board of directors who hire a manager and assistant manager to run the
fitness club. Philadelphia Fitness Cooperative does not seek to make a profit. Each year,
the membership fees are adjusted with the intention of bringing in just enough revenue to
cover projected expenses. The fitness club’s budget is an important part of that process.

AFTER COMPLETING THIS CHAPTER, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
1 List and explain five purposes of budgeting systems.
2 Describe the similarities and differences in the operational budgets
prepared by manufacturers, service-industry firms, merchandisers,
and nonprofit organizations.
3 Explain the concept of activity-based budgeting and the benefits it brings to the
budgeting process.
4 Prepare each of the budget schedules that make up the master budget.
5 Discuss the role of assumptions and predictions in budgeting.
6 Describe a typical organization’s process of budget administration.
7 Understand the importance of budgeting product life-cycle costs.
8 Discuss the behavioral implications of budgetary slack and participative budgeting.
Developing a budget is a critical step in planning any economic activity. This is true
for businesses, for governmental agencies, and for individuals. We all must budget our
money to meet day-to-day expenses and to plan for major expenditures, such as buying a
car or paying for college tuition. Similarly, businesses of all types and governmental units
at every level must make financial plans to carry out routine operations, to plan for major
expenditures, and to help in making financial decisions.
Purposes of Budgeting Systems
A budget is a detailed plan, expressed in quantitative terms, that specifies how resources

will be acquired and used during a specified period of time. The procedures used to
List and explain five purposes develop a budget constitute a budgeting system. Budgeting systems have five primary
of budgeting systems. purposes: planning; facilitating communication and coordination; allocating resources;
controlling profit and operations; and evaluating performance and providing incentives.
Planning The most obvious purpose of a budget is to quantify a plan of action. The
budgeting process forces the individuals who make up an organization to plan ahead.
The development of a quarterly budget for a Sheraton Hotel, for example, forces the
hotel manager, the reservation manager, and the food and beverage manager to plan for
the staffing and supplies needed to meet anticipated demand for the hotel’s services.
Facilitating Communication and Coordination For any organization to be
effective, each manager throughout the organization must be aware of the plans made by
other managers. In order to plan reservations and ticket sales effectively, the reservations
manager for D elta Air Lines must know the flight schedules developed by the airline’s
route manager. The budgeting process pulls together the plans of each manager in an
organization.

Chapter 9 Profit Planning and Activity-Based Budgeting 349
Allocating Resources Generally, an organization’s resources are limited, and
budgets provide one means of allocating resources among competing uses. The city of
Chicago, for example, must allocate its revenue among basic life services (such as police
and fire protection), maintenance of property and equipment (such as city streets, parks,
and vehicles), and other community services (such as child-care services and programs to
prevent alcohol and drug abuse).
Controlling Profit and Operations A budget is a plan, and plans are subject to
change. Nevertheless, a budget serves as a useful benchmark with which actual results can “Budgeting is used exten-
be compared. For example, Prudential Insurance Company can compare its actual sales of sively for cost control. Each

agers evaluate the firm’s effectiveness in selling insurance. The next two chapters examine a plant budget, and then

is responsible for his
or her own cost center. . . .
Evaluating Performance and Providing Incentives Comparing actual There are budgets for

formance, they also can be used to provide incentives for people to perform well. For Best Foods
example, G eneral Motors Corporation, like many other companies, provides incentives (a subsidiary of Unilever)
for managers to improve profits by awarding bonuses to managers who meet or exceed
their budgeted profit goals.
Types of Budgets
Different types of budgets serve different purposes. A m aster budget, or p rofit plan,
is a comprehensive set of budgets covering all phases of an organization’s operations
for a specified period of time. We will examine a master budget in detail later in this
chapter.
Budgeted financial statements, often called pro
forma financial statements, show how the organiza-
tion’s financial statements will appear at a specified
time if operations proceed according to plan. Bud-
geted financial statements include a budgeted income
statement, a b udgeted balance sheet, and a b udgeted
statement of cash flows.
A c apital budget is a plan for the acquisition
of capital assets, such as buildings and equipment.
Capital budgeting is covered in depth later in the
text. A financial budget is a plan that shows how
the organization will acquire its financial resources,
such as through the issuance of stock or incurrence
of debt.
Budgets are developed for specific time periods. Diverse organizations use budgets for a variety of reasons.
Short-range budgets cover a year, a quarter, or a month, A cruise line, such as Carnival, uses budgets to plan for
whereas long-range budgets cover periods longer than meeting the payroll and operating expenses and to
a year. R olling budgets are continually updated by coordinate operations by matching staffing with projected
periodically adding a new incremental time period, cruise demand. Carnival also uses its budgeting process
such as a quarter, and dropping the period just com- to allocate capital improvement funds among competing

budgets or continuous budgets. facilities.

Components of a Master Budget
The Master Budget: A Planning Tool
The master budget, the principal output of a budgeting system, is a comprehensive profit
plan that ties together all phases of an organization’s operations. The master budget com-
prises many separate budgets, or schedules, that are interdependent. Exhibit 9–1 portrays
these interrelationships in a flowchart.
Sales of Services or Goods
The starting point for any master budget is a sales revenue budget based on a sales fore-
cast for services or goods. Airlines forecast the number of passengers on each of their
routes. Banks forecast the number and dollar amount of consumer loans and home mort-
gages to be provided. Hotels forecast the number of rooms that will be occupied dur-
ing various seasons. Manufacturing and merchandising companies forecast sales of their
goods. Some companies sell both goods and services. For example, Sears is a large mer-
chandising company, but its S ears Auto Service Centers provide the firm with substantial
service revenue.
Sales Forecasting
All companies have two things in common when it comes to forecasting sales of ser-
vices or goods. S ales forecasting is a critical step in the budgeting process, and it is very
difficult to do accurately.

Chapter 9 Profit Planning and Activity-Based Budgeting 351
Various procedures are used in sales forecasting, and the final forecast usually com-
bines information from many different sources. Many firms have a top-management-level
market research staff whose job is to coordinate the company’s sales forecasting efforts.
Typically, everyone from key executives to the firm’s sales personnel will be asked to
contribute sales projections.
Major factors considered when forecasting sales include the following:
“Sales forecasting is difficult

in every industry, but it’s

to use alternative energy sources?)
6. The intended pricing policy of the company.
7. Planned advertising and product promotion.

on what has happened.” (9c)
10. Market research studies.
Caterpillar
The starting point in the sales forecasting process
is generally the sales level of the prior year. Then the
market research staff considers the information dis-
cussed above along with input from key executives and
sales personnel. In many firms, elaborate econometric
models are built to incorporate all the available infor-
mation systematically. (E conometric means economic
measurement.) Statistical methods, such as regression
analysis and probability distributions for sales, are
often used. All in all, a great deal of effort generally
goes into the sales forecast, since it is such a critical
step in the budgeting process. Making a sales forecast
is like shooting an arrow. If the archer’s aim is off by
only a fraction of an inch, the arrow will go further
and further astray and miss the bull’s eye by a wide One advantage that “etailers,” such as Amazon.com, have

Operational Budgets
Based on the sales budget, a company develops a set of o perational budgets that specify
how its operations will be carried out to meet the demand for its goods or services. The
budgets constituting this operational portion of the master budget are depicted in the
middle portion of Exhibit 9–1 .

is prepared.
Merchandising Firms The operational portion of the master budget is similar in a
merchandising firm, but instead of a production budget for goods, a merchandiser devel-
ops a budget for merchandise purchases. A merchandising firm will not have a budget
for direct material, because it does not engage in production. However, the merchandiser
will develop budgets for labor (or personnel), overhead, and selling and administrative
expenses.
Service-Industry Firms Based on the sales budget for its services, a service-
industry firm develops a set of budgets that show how the demand for those services will
be met. An airline, for example, prepares the following operational budgets: a budget of
planned air miles to be flown; material budgets for spare aircraft parts, aircraft fuel, and
in-flight food; labor budgets for flight crews and maintenance personnel; and an overhead
budget.
Cash Budget Every business prepares a cash budget. This budget shows expected
cash receipts, as a result of selling goods or services, and planned cash disbursements, to
pay the bills incurred by the firm.
Summary of Operational Budgets Operational budgets differ since they are
adapted to the operations of individual companies in various industries. However, opera-
tional budgets are also similar in important ways. In each firm, they encompass a detailed
plan for using the basic factors of production—material, labor, and overhead—to produce
a product or provide a service.
Budgeted Financial Statements
The final portion of the master budget, depicted in Exhibit 9–1 , includes a budgeted income
statement, a budgeted balance sheet, and a budgeted statement of cash flows. These bud-
geted financial statements show the overall financial results of the organization’s planned
operations for the budget period.
Nonprofit Organizations
The master budget for a nonprofit organization includes many of the components shown
in Exhibit 9–1 . However, there are some important differences. Many nonprofit orga-
nizations provide services free of charge. Hence, there is no sales budget as shown in
Exhibit 9–1 . However, such organizations do begin their budgeting process with a budget
that shows the level of services to be provided. For example, the budget for the city of
Houston would show the planned levels of various public services, such as the hours of
operation for libraries and parks.
Nonprofit organizations also prepare budgets showing their anticipated funding. The
city of Houston budgets for such revenue sources as city taxes, state and federal revenue
sharing, and sale of municipal bonds.
In summary, all organizations begin the budgeting process with plans for (1) the goods
or services to be provided and (2) the revenue to be available, whether from sales or from
other funding sources.

operations. This approach has been used to identify and implement cost reduction and

process improvement initiatives. Then, an activity-by-activity analysis of each department
has allowed process improvement savings to be factored into the forecasted costs for
each department in the next budget cycle. 1
A T&T Paradyne designs and produces medium- and high-speed data communications
equipment, which provides an interface between telephone networks and computers.
The company’s activity-based costing project ultimately led to activity-based budgeting.
As ABM and ABB matured at AT&T Paradyne, the company began to experience a cul-
ture change. A key lesson learned in this case was that linking activity-based costing to
the budgeting process and performance evaluation led to the integration of ABC into the
management of the company. 2
Activity-Based Budgeting1 2
The process of constructing a master budget can be significantly enhanced if the con-
cepts of activity-based costing are applied. 3 Activity-based costing uses a two-stage Learning Objective 3
cost-assignment process. In stage I, overhead costs are assigned to cost pools that rep- Explain the concept of
resent the most significant activities constituting the production process. The activities activity-based budgeting and
identified vary across manufacturers, but such activities as engineering design, the benefits it brings to the
material handling, machine setup, production scheduling, inspection, quality control, budgeting process.
and purchasing provide examples.
After assigning costs to the activity cost pools in stage I, cost drivers are identified
that are appropriate for each cost pool. Then, in stage II, the overhead costs are allocated
from each activity cost pool to cost objects (e.g., products, services, and customers) in
proportion to the amount of activity consumed.
Exhibit 9–2 portrays the two-stage allocation process used in activity-based costing
systems.
Applying ABC concepts to the budgeting process yields activity-based budget-
ing (ABB).4 Under ABB, the first step is to specify the products or services to be pro- Commenting on how the

budget the resources necessary to carry out the activities.
I n the next section of the chapter, we will illustrate the process of constructing a

the budgeting process. In the context of the master-budget illustration, we will explore the

cess is highly automated, using several machines to cut out pieces of tent fabric and sew
them together to form a lightweight but durable backpacking tent. Production of the alu-
minum tent poles is outsourced to a company in Kansas City, and the poles are purchased
on a just-in-time basis so they can be packaged with the finished tents just before they are
shipped. Initially, Edwards called her firm Cozycamp Company, and its sales were made
to regional retailers in the mountain states using a traditional sales approach. Three years cozycamp.com
ago, however, Edwards changed the company’s name to Cozycamp.com and made a major
foray into the world of Internet sales. Now almost 75 percent of Cozycamp.com’s sales
are made through the company’s website. Although Cozycamp.com retained several of
its sales personnel to handle the traditional sales to area retailers, new personnel had to be
hired to handle the company’s Internet sales environment. Tents are shipped to Internet
customers via U PS, F edEx, and other express delivery services.
The 20x2 master budget for Cozycamp.com has just been completed. It contains the
following schedules, which are displayed and explained in the following pages.

The first step in developing Cozycamp.com’s 20x2 master budget is to prepare the sales
budget, which is displayed as schedule 1. This budget displays the projected sales in
units for each quarter and then multiplies the unit sales by the sales price to determine
sales revenue. Notice that there is a significant seasonal pattern in the sales forecast, with
the bulk of the sales coming in the spring and summer.

Production Budget
The production budget shows the number of units of services or goods that are to be pro-
duced during a budget period. Cozycamp.com’s production budget, displayed as sched-
ule 2, determines the number of tents to be produced each quarter based on the quarterly
sales projections in the sales budget. Schedule 2 is based on the following formula.

Focus on the second-quarter column in schedule 2, which is shaded. Expected sales
are 15,000 tents, and Edwards desires to have 2,000 finished units on hand at the end of
the quarter. This is 10 percent of the expected sales for the third quarter. However, 1,500
tents are expected to be in inventory at the beginning of the second quarter. Thus, only
15,500 tents need to be produced.

Direct-Material Budget
The d irect-material budget shows the number of units and the cost of material to be
purchased and used during a budget period. C ozycamp.com’s direct-material budget,
which is displayed as schedule 3, has two sections: one for tent fabric and one for tent
poles. As is true for almost all manufacturers, C ozycamp.com’s direct-material cost is a
unit-level cost. 5 Each tent requires 12 yards of fabric and one tent pole kit. The tent poles
required for each tent are prepackaged in a kit by the vendor in Kansas City and deliv-
ered to Cozycamp.com on a just-in-time basis.6 The top section of Cozycamp.com’s
direct-material budget shows the total amount of tent fabric needed to make tents during
each quarter. The shaded portion of schedule 3 computes the amount of tent fabric to
be purchased each quarter. This part of the schedule is based on the following formula.
5 A unit-level cost is one that must be incurred each time a unit is produced.
6 Just-in-time production and inventory control systems are covered in Chapter 5.

‡S ince the tent pole kits are prepackaged by the vendor and delivered on a just-in-time basis, there is no need for buffer inventory stocks. Thus,
the number of tent pole kits purchased each quarter is the same as the number needed each quarter.

358 Chapter 9 Profit Planning and Activity-Based Budgeting
Production and Purchasing: An Important Link Notice the important
link between planned production and purchases of raw material. This link is apparent in
schedule 3, and it is also emphasized in the formula preceding the schedule. Let’s focus
on the second quarter. Since 15,500 tents are to be produced, 186,000 yards of tent mate-
rial will be needed (15,500 tents times 12 yards per unit). In addition, Edwards desires
to have 22,800 yards of material in inventory at the end of the quarter.7 Thus, total needs
are 208,800 yards. Does Cozycamp.com need to purchase this much raw material? No
it does not, because 18,600 yards will be in inventory at the beginning of the quarter.
Therefore, the firm needs to purchase only 190,200 yards of material during the quarter
(208,800 yards less 18,600 yards in the beginning inventory).
Inventory Management The linkage between planned production and raw
material purchases is a particularly critical linkage in manufacturing firms. Thus,
considerable effort is devoted to careful inventory planning and management. How
did Edwards decide how much raw material to have in inventory at the end of each
quarter? Examination of schedule 3 reveals that each quarter’s desired ending inventory
of raw material is 10 percent of the m aterial needed for production in the next quarter.
For example, 22,800 yards of raw material will be in inventory at the end of the sec-
ond quarter, because 228,000 yards will be needed for production in the third quarter
(22,800 ! 10% " 228,000). The effect of this approach is to have a larger ending inven-
tory when the next quarter’s planned production is greater. Inventories are drawn down
when the subsequent quarter’s planned production is lower.
Further discussion of inventory management can be found in Appendix III on
page 780.
Direct-Labor Budget
The direct-labor budget shows the number of hours and the cost of the direct labor
to be used during the budget period. Cozycamp.com’s direct-labor budget is displayed
as schedule 4. Based on each quarter’s planned production, this schedule computes
the amount of direct labor needed each quarter and the cost of the required labor.
Cozycamp.com is a relatively small company, and owner Mary Edwards hires all of her
direct-labor production employees on a part-time basis only. This allows Cozycamp.
com to meet the labor demands of a given time period, which vary significantly with the
seasonal pattern of demand and production. Thus, Cozycamp.com’s direct labor may be
adjusted up or down to meet short-term needs. As a result, direct labor for this company
is a unit-level cost. As schedule 4 shows, each tent manufactured requires half an hour
of direct labor.
A Note on Direct Labor and the Cost Hierarchy Where direct labor
belongs in the cost hierarchy depends on management’s ability to adjust the organiza-
tion’s labor force to match short-term requirements, as well as management’s attitude
about making such adjustments. 8 Either for strategic business reasons or due to ethical
concerns, many companies strive to maintain a relatively stable labor force. If produc-
tion employees are retained when production declines, then direct labor will not be a
unit-level cost. In the extreme case, where employees are virtually never laid off, direct
labor becomes a facility-level, or general-operations-level, cost. Cozycamp.com’s ability
to easily adjust the total hours of its part-time workforce results in a unit-level designation
for direct-labor cost in this situation.
7 It often is desirable to have a buffer inventory just before a bottleneck manufacturing operation.
8 A typical cost hierarchy includes costs incurred at the unit level, batch level, product-sustaining level, customer
level, and facility or general-operations level. Cost hierarchies are discussed in detail in Chapter 5.

Manufacturing-Overhead Budget
The manufacturing-overhead budget shows the cost of overhead expected to be
incurred in the production process during the budget period. Cozycamp.com’s manufac-
turing overhead budget, displayed as schedule 5, lists the expected cost of each overhead
item by quarter. At the bottom of the schedule, the total budgeted overhead for each quar-
ter is shown. Then each quarter’s depreciation is subtracted to determine the total cash
disbursements to be expected for overhead during each quarter. This cash disbursement
information will be needed later in the budgeting process when the cash disbursements
budget is constructed (schedule 8).
Activity-Based Budgeting and the Cost Hierarchy Cozycamp.com uses
an activity-based budgeting (ABB) approach in the construction of the manufacturing-
overhead budget. This budget explicitly uses activity-based costing information in that
the budgeted costs for various overhead items are based on the expected quantity of the
appropriate cost driver. For example, the cost driver used to budget setup costs is the
number of production runs.
In Cozycamp.com’s cost hierarchy, unit-level costs include indirect material and elec-
tricity used to run the production machinery. 9 Batch-level costs include machine setup,
purchasing and material handling, and quality control and inspection. The cost driver
for these costs is the number of production runs. A run typically produces 500 tents.
Cozycamp.com’s only product-level cost is design engineering. The company typically
develops one new tent design each quarter. Each new design costs $1,200. The remaining
overhead costs in schedule 5 are costs incurred at the facility, or general-operations, level.
Benefits of ABB Proponents of ABB believe that real, sustainable payoffs from

the budget (see schedule 5), but 15 production runs are used to produce these 6,000 units
instead of 12 runs as specified in the budget? According to schedule 5, setup cost is $400
per production run ($4,800/12 runs). Therefore, 15 runs would result in $6,000 of setup

amounts of expenditures for selling, general, and administrative expenses during the bud-
get period. Cozycamp.com’s selling, general, and administrative expense budget is dis-
played as schedule 6. This budget lists the expenses of administering the firm and selling
its product.

Chapter 9 Profit Planning and Activity-Based Budgeting 361
Activity-Based Budgeting and the Cost Hierarchy Similar to the
manufacturing-overhead budget, Cozycamp.com’s SG&A expense budget reflects the
activity-based budgeting (ABB) approach. Activity-based costing information was used
to develop this budget. For example, the cost driver used to budget sales commissions
(for sales in the firm’s traditional market) is the number of units sold.
In Cozycamp.com’s cost hierarchy, the only unit-level marketing expenses con-
sist of sales commissions. 11 For Cozycamp’s traditional sales through regional retail
outlets, sales personnel are paid commissions based on the number of units sold. The
SG&A budget reflects a $5 commission paid on each tent sold through traditional out-
lets, which account for 25 percent of C ozycamp.com’s sales. In the second quarter, for
example, sales commissions are predicted to be $18,750 (15,000 tents " 25% tradi-
tional sales " $5).
The customer-level expenses incurred by Cozycamp.com are the sales personnel sal-
aries, which differ depending on whether the customers are traditional regional retailers
or Web shoppers. In order to sell its tents in the traditional marketplace, Cozycamp.com
employs sales personnel who travel to the retailers in the area and personally take orders.
These sales personnel receive both a salary and sales commissions. (The sales commis-
sions are unit-level expenses, as noted above.) To serve its Internet customers, Cozycamp
.com employs computer operators to update the company’s Web site and a couple of tele-
phone operators to provide customer service over the phone. For example, some Internet
customers are hesitant to give their credit card numbers to Cozycamp.com online, so they
place their orders online and then phone in to an authorized telephone number to submit
their credit card information.
The remainder of Cozycamp.com’s selling, general, and administrative expenses are
incurred at the facility or general-operations level.
11 A typical cost hierarchy includes costs incurred at the unit level, batch level, product-sustaining level, customer
level, and facility, or general-operations, level. Cost hierarchies are discussed in detail in Chapter 5.

Uncollectible accounts ............................................. $22,500 $67,500 $90,000 $45,000 $225,000
† The revenue in the prior quarter (i.e., the 4th quarter of 20x1) is assumed to be $2,250,000. Therefore, the $405,000 is 18% of $2,250,000.
How to Budget Cash Receipts To understand how the cash receipts budget is
prepared, let’s focus again on the second quarter column, which is shaded. The $3,375,000
of total revenue comes directly from schedule 1, the sales budget (second column, last
row). Since most of Cozycamp.com’s sales are on account, not all of the second quarter’s
revenue will be collected during the second quarter. The cash that the firm will collect dur-
ing the second quarter comprises two components, as depicted in the following diagram.
1st Quarter 2nd Quarter

Total cash receipts
($2,700,000 + $202,500) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $2,902,500
The second quarter’s total cash receipts are the sum of $2,700,000 (80 percent of second
quarter sales) and $202,500 (18 percent of first quarter sales).
One final point to notice is that 2 percent of each quarter’s sales are not expected
to be collected. Thus, the $67,500 of second quarter uncollectible accounts amounts to

2 percent of the second quarter’s revenue ($67,500 ! 2% " $3,375,000). Almost all of
Cozycamp.com’s uncollectible accounts relate to the company’s traditional sales.
Cash Disbursements Budget
The cash disbursements budget details the expected cash payments during a budget
period. Schedule 8 displays Cozycamp.com’s cash disbursements budget. The darker-
shaded, top portion shows the schedule of cash payments for raw material purchases,
which are made on account. The company pays for 60 percent of its purchases on account
during the quarter in which the purchase is made. The remaining 40 percent of each
quarter’s purchases are paid for during the quarter following the purchase.
The lighter-shaded, lower portion of schedule 8 shows all of Cozycamp.com’s direct-
labor, manufacturing overhead, and selling, general, and administrative expenditures.

364 Chapter 9 Profit Planning and Activity-Based Budgeting
How to Budget Cash Disbursements Cozycamp.com purchases raw mate-
rial, direct labor, and various services. The raw material purchases are made on account,
which means payment is not made in cash at the time of the purchase. The shaded top
portion of schedule 8 shows the purchases on account. Let’s focus on the second quarter
column. The second quarter’s raw material purchases on account amount to $2,021,800.
Does the company pay for all of the $2,021,800 purchases on account during the same
quarter? No, it does not. As the following diagram shows, the second quarter’s actual
cash payment for purchases made on account comprises two components.
1st Quarter 2nd Quarter
Total purchases on account. . . . . . . . . . . . . . $870,600 $2,021,800

Total
($348,240 + $1,213,080) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $1,561,320
The second quarter’s total cash payments f or purchases made on account are the
sum of $1,213,080 (which relates to second quarter purchases on account) and $348,240
(which relates to first quarter purchases on account).
We are not finished with the second quarter’s cash disbursements yet, because
Cozycamp.com also pays for some of its purchases in cash at the time of purchase.
These cash expenditures are detailed in the unshaded lower portion of schedule 8. The
amounts are drawn from schedules 4, 5, and 6, which detail expenditures for direct-
labor, manufacturing-overhead, and selling, general, and administrative expenses,
respectively. For example, schedule 4 lists $116,250 for direct labor in the second quar-
ter; schedule 5 lists $261,000 for cash expenditures on manufacturing-overhead costs;
and schedule 6 lists $354,750 for selling, general, and administrative expenditures.
Finally, the last row in the cash disbursements budget (schedule 8) shows the total
cash disbursements during each quarter. Thus, the $2,293,320 total payment in the second
quarter is the sum of $1,561,320 (for raw material purchases on account) and $732,000
for other purchases made in cash.
Cash Budget: Combining Receipts and Disbursements
The c ash budget details the expected cash receipts and disbursements during a budget
period. Cozycamp.com’s completed cash budget is displayed as schedule 9. The darker-
shaded, top portion pulls together the cash receipts and cash disbursements detailed in
schedules 7 and 8. The lower portion of schedule 9 discloses the company’s plans to take
out a short-term bank loan on January 2, 20x2, for the purpose of building an addition to
its production facility. The pattern of construction payments reflects high outlays early
in the year as the major construction takes place. The high payment in the fourth quarter
is due to the costs of reconfiguring the production line after the addition is finished. The
company will repay the loan (with interest) in four equal installments on the last day of
each quarter in 20x2. The funds for this repayment will come from excess cash generated
from operations during 20x2.
Also shown in schedule 9 are the interest payments on the short-term bank loan.

Budgeted Schedule of Cost of Goods Manufactured and Sold
The b udgeted schedule of cost of goods manufactured and sold details the direct mate-
rial, direct-labor, and manufacturing-overhead costs to be incurred, and shows the cost of
the goods to be sold during the budget period. Schedule 10 shows Cozycamp.com’s bud-
geted schedule of cost of goods manufactured and sold. The following Excel spreadsheet
shows how the cost of the beginning and ending inventories of finished goods in sched-
ule 10 are determined. From schedule 2, we see that the expected beginning and ending
inventories of finished goods for 20x2 consist of 500 units. The absorption manufactur-
ing cost for one unit of product is $163.50. The direct-material cost per unit is $128.00
($108.00 # $20.00) (schedule 3), and the unit direct-labor cost is $7.50 (schedule 4).
Recall that the a bsorption cost includes the direct-material and direct-labor costs and an
allocation of all manufacturing overhead costs (i.e., overhead at the unit, batch, product,
and facility, or general-operations, levels). The overhead cost data come from schedule 5.

Assumptions and Predictions Underlying the Master Budget
A master budget is based on many assumptions and estimates of unknown parameters.

Some estimates tend to be quite accurate, while other predictions are much more difficult
to make accurately. Discuss the role of assumptions

turn our attention away from the manufacturing environment of Cozycamp.com and
consider the budget prepared for Philadelphia Fitness Cooperative. This service orga-
nization, located in suburban Philadelphia, operates as a cooperative. The members
of the club elect a board of directors who hire a manager and assistant manager to
run the fitness club. Philadelphia Fitness Cooperative does not seek to make a profit.

Annual Budget: Philadelphia
Fitness Cooperative
Each year the membership fees are adjusted with the intention of bringing in just
enough revenue to cover projected expenses. The fitness club’s budget is an impor-
tant part of that process.
Philadelphia Fitness Cooperative’s annual budget is displayed in Exhibit 9–5 .
The fitness cooperative sells individual adult, family, and youth/student memberships.
The individual adult and family memberships can be monthly or annual, with a sig-
nificant price break offered on the annual memberships. The fitness cooperative also
allows licensed massage therapists and nutritional counselors to meet clients in the

club’s facilities and charges a fee to the professional offering the service. The staff
of the cooperative includes the following personnel: a manager and assistant manager
to administer the operation; various part-time instructors who teach classes such as
yoga, pilates, aerobic exercise, weight training, and proper use of the club’s fitness
equipment; reception and cashier personnel; and custodians. Other operating expenses
include such items as utilities, insurance, supplies, maintenance, property taxes, adver-
tising, and depreciation.
Notice the differences and similarities between the budgets for Cozycamp.com and
Philadelphia Fitness. Cozycamp.com’s budgeted income statement (schedule 11 on
page 366) subtracts cost of goods sold expense from sales revenue to calculate the gross
margin. In contrast, Philadelphia Fitness does not show cost of goods sold because the
fitness cooperative does not sell a physical product. Nor does it show a gross margin.
The Philadelphia Fitness Cooperative budget shows revenue from membership dues
and rental of space to licensed massage therapists and nutritional counselors, and oper-
ating expenses. While Cozycamp.com’s budget shows net income, the Philadelphia
Fitness budget refers to revenue less operating expenses. This emphasizes the fitness
cooperative’s status as a nonprofit enterprise.
There are also similarities between these two budgets. For example, both businesses
experience significant seasonality in activity. Cozycamp.com sells more tents in the sec-
ond and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters. Philadelphia Fitness sells more
monthly memberships in the cold months (first and fourth quarters) than in the warmer
months (second and third quarters). During quarters with increased sales activity, both
businesses show correspondingly higher expenses.
Now let’s briefly discuss some of the assumptions and predictions that are reflected
in Philadelphia Fitness Cooperative’s budget. First, the fitness club’s managers have
assumed that people will continue to use the club more in the colder months of the year
than in the warmer months as they have in the past. Second, the managers have assumed
that the split between monthly and annual memberships for both individuals and families
will be about the same as in the past. Based on these assumptions, the managers have pre-
dicted membership sales for each quarter. For example, the budget reflects the following
predictions for memberships and prices in the first and second quarters. Notice that the
monthly memberships decline in the second quarter, whereas the annual memberships
are constant across the entire year.
Membership Type 1st Quarter 2nd Quarter
Individual adult, monthly 290 @ $60 per month 200 @ $60 per month
Individual adult, annual 200 @ $600 per year 200 @ $600 per year
Family, monthly 50 @ $150 per month 40 @ $50 per month
Family, annual 130 @ $1,500 per year 130 @ $1,500 per year
Youth/student 100 @ $30 per month 90 @ $30 per month
The Philadelphia Fitness Cooperative reflects many other predictions, such as sala-
ries, wage rates, electric and other utility rates, insurance and property tax rates, and so
forth. Some of these predictions—property tax rates, for example—would likely be quite
accurate. Other predictions would be more difficult, as, for example, the cost of natural
gas for heating purposes due to its dependence on the weather.
Financial Planning Models
Managers must make assumptions and predictions in preparing budgets because organi-
zations operate in a world of uncertainty. One way of coping with that uncertainty is to
supplement the budgeting process with a f inancial planning model. A f inancial planning
model is a set of mathematical relationships that express the interactions among the vari-
ous operational, financial, and environmental events that determine the overall results of
an organization’s activities. A financial planning model is a mathematical expression of
all the relationships expressed in the flowchart of Exhibit 9–1 .

372 Chapter 9 Profit Planning and Activity-Based Budgeting
To illustrate this concept, focus on the following equation, which is used to budget
Philadelphia Fitness Cooperative’s employee fringe benefits.
(Employee fringe benefits) ! .30 " (Total salaries and wages)
However, suppose the cooperative’s managers are uncertain about this 30 percent
estimate. A financial planning model might include the following equation instead.
(Employee fringe benefits) ! p " (Total salaries and wages)
where 0 % p % 1.0.
The budget staff can run the financial planning model as many times as desired on
a computer, using a different value for p each time. Perhaps the following values would
be tried: .29, .295, .30, .305, and .31. Now management can answer the question, What
if employee fringe benefits cost 29 percent of salaries and wages? In a fully developed
financial planning model, all of the key estimates and assumptions are expressed as gen-
eral mathematical relationships. Then the model is run on a computer many times to
determine the impact of different combinations of these unknown variables. “What if”
questions can be answered about such unknown variables as inflation, interest rates, the
value of the dollar, demand, competitors’ actions, union demands in forthcoming wage
negotiations, and a host of other factors. The widespread availability of personal comput-
ers and electronic-spreadsheet software has made financial planning models a more and
more common management tool.

budget administration. director specifies the process by which budget data will be gathered, collects the informa-
tion, and prepares the master budget. To communicate budget procedures and deadlines
to employees throughout the organization, the budget director often develops and dis-
seminates a b udget manual. The budget manual states who is responsible for providing
various types of information, when the information is required, and what form the infor-
mation is to take. For example, the budget manual for a manufacturing firm might specify
that each regional sales director is to send an estimate of the following year’s sales, by
product line, to the budget director by September 1. The budget manual also states who
should receive each schedule when the master budget is complete.
A b udget committee, consisting of key senior executives, often is appointed to
advise the budget director during the preparation of the budget. The authority to give
final approval to the master budget usually belongs to the board of directors, or a board
of trustees in many nonprofit organizations. Usually the board has a subcommittee whose
task is to examine the proposed budget carefully and recommend approval or any changes
deemed necessary. By exercising its authority to make changes in the budget and grant
final approval, the board of directors, or trustees, can wield considerable influence on the

BUDGET ADMINISTRATION AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY A ccounting
Cornell University’s annual budget covers the period from July 1 through the following June P ractice
30. The budgeting process begins in October, when the deans and senior vice presidents
Cornell University
have meetings to discuss the programs the university will conduct during the following
budget year. The university’s priorities in educational, research, and public service pro-
grams are established during these meetings. In early January, the university’s budget
director, together with other members of the Operating Plans Committee, settles on a
set of assumptions to be used during the remainder of the budgeting process. These
assumptions include such key forecasts as the next year’s inflation rate, interest rates,
and tuition levels. Based on these assumptions, the dean of each of Cornell’s colleges or
professional schools must develop a detailed budget for salaries and general expenses.
These detailed budgets are prepared during January and February by the financial staff in
each college or professional school. In March, the university president and provost review
these budgets with the deans. After any needed revisions have been made, the budgets
for the various colleges and professional schools are consolidated by the university con-
troller’s staff into a master budget. This budget is presented to the university’s board of
trustees in May for final approval.
be collected and integrated by the corporate controller’s office. One result of this cum-
bersome approach was that a disproportionate amount of time was spent compiling and
verifying data from multiple sources. Under e-budgeting, both the submission of budget
information and its compilation are accomplished electronically by the Web-based bud-
geting software. Thus, e-budgeting is just one more area where the Internet has trans-
formed how the workplace operates in the era of e-business.1 3
International Aspects of Budgeting
As the economies and cultures of countries throughout
the world become intertwined, more and more com-
panies are becoming multinational in their operations.
Firms with international operations face a variety of
additional challenges in preparing their budgets. First, a
multinational firm’s budget must reflect the translation
of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. Since almost all
the world’s currencies fluctuate in their values relative
to the dollar, this makes budgeting for those translations
difficult. Although multinationals have sophisticated
financial ways of hedging against such currency fluc-
tuations, the budgeting task is still more challenging.
Second, it is difficult to prepare budgets when infla-
tion is high or unpredictable. While the United States
has experienced periods of high inflation, some foreign As this photo from Thailand shows, McDonald’s operates
countries have experienced hyperinflation, sometimes throughout the world. Multinational companies face

dicting such high inflation rates is difficult and further
complicates a multinational’s budgeting process. Finally, the economies of all coun-
tries fluctuate in terms of consumer demand, availability of skilled labor, laws affecting

Budgeting Product Life-Cycle Costs
A relatively recent focus of the budgeting process is to plan for all of the costs that will be
Learning Objective 7 incurred throughout a product’s life cycle, before a commitment is made to the product.1 4
Understand the importance of Product life-cycle costs encompass the following five phases in a product’s life cycle

costs.
• Preliminary design.
• Detailed design and testing.
• Production.
• Distribution and customer service.
In order to justify a product’s introduction, the sales revenues it will generate over
its life must be sufficient to cover all of these costs. Thus, planning these life-cycle costs
is a crucial step in making a decision about the introduction of a new product. This is
particularly true for firms with very short product life cycles, such as some products in
the computer and electronics industries. When product life cycles are as short as a year
or two, the firm does not have time to adjust its pricing strategy or production methods to
ensure that the product turns a profit. Management must be fairly certain before a com-
mitment is made to the product that its life-cycle costs will be covered. As Exhibit 9–6
shows, most of a product’s life-cycle costs are committed rather early in the product’s
life. By the time the planning, design, and testing phases are complete, roughly 85 per-
cent of this product’s life-cycle costs have been committed, while only about 5 percent
actually have been incurred.
Given the early commitment that must be made to significant downstream costs in a
product’s life cycle, it is crucial to budget these costs as early as possible.

Behavioral Impact of Budgets
One of the underlying themes stressed in this text is the behavioral impact of managerial

accounting practices. There is no other area where the behavioral implications are more
important than in the budgeting area. A budget affects virtually everyone in an organiza- Discuss the behavioral

process can have considerable influence on an organization’s overall effectiveness.
A great deal of study has been devoted to the behavioral effects of budgets. Here we
will barely scratch the surface by briefly considering two issues: budgetary slack and
participative budgeting.
Budgetary Slack: Padding the Budget
The information upon which a budget is based comes largely from people throughout an
organization. For example, the sales forecast relies on market research and analysis by
market research staff but also incorporates the projections of sales personnel. If a territorial
sales manager’s performance is evaluated on the basis of whether the sales budget for the
territory is exceeded, what is the incentive for the sales manager in projecting sales? The
incentive is to give a conservative, or cautiously low, sales estimate. The sales manager’s
performance will look much better in the eyes of top management when a conservative
estimate is exceeded than when an ambitious estimate is not met. At least that is the percep-
tion of many sales managers, and, in the behavioral area, perceptions are what count most.
When a supervisor provides a departmental cost projection for budgetary purposes,
there is an incentive to overestimate costs. When the actual cost incurred in the depart-
ment proves to be less than the inflated cost projection, the supervisor appears to have
managed in a cost-effective way.
These illustrations are examples of padding the budget. Budget padding means
underestimating revenue or overestimating costs. The difference between the revenue or
cost projection that a person provides and a realistic estimate of the revenue or cost is
called b udgetary slack. For example, if a manager believes the annual utilities cost will
be $18,000, but gives a budgetary projection of $20,000, the manager has built $2,000 of
slack into the budget.
Why do people pad budgets with budgetary slack? There are three primary reasons.
First, people often perceive that their performance will look better in their superiors’
eyes if they can “beat the budget.” Second, budgetary slack often is used to cope with
uncertainty. A departmental supervisor may feel confident in the cost projections for
10 cost items. However, the supervisor also may feel that some unforeseen event during
the budgetary period could result in unanticipated costs. For example, an unexpected
machine breakdown could occur. One way of dealing with that unforeseen event is to
pad the budget. If nothing goes wrong, the supervisor can beat the cost budget. If some
hiL10912_ch09_346-403.indd 375 7/19/10 10:37 PM
================================================================================
PAGE 411
================================================================================

376 Chapter 9 Profit Planning and Activity-Based Budgeting
negative event does occur, the supervisor can use the budgetary slack to absorb the
impact of the event and still meet the cost budget.
The third reason why cost budgets are padded is that budgetary cost projections are
often cut in the resource-allocation process. Thus, we have a vicious circle. Budgetary
projections are padded because they will likely be cut, and they are cut because they are
likely to have been padded.
How does an organization solve the problem of budgetary slack? First, it can avoid
relying on the budget as a negative evaluation tool. If a departmental supervisor is
harassed by the budget director or some other top manager every time a budgetary cost
projection is exceeded, the likely behavioral response will be to pad the budget. In con-
trast, if the supervisor is allowed some managerial discretion to exceed the budget when
necessary, there will be less tendency toward budgetary padding. Second, managers can
be given incentives not only to achieve budgetary projections but also to p rovide accurate
projections. This can be accomplished by asking managers to justify all or some of their
projections and by rewarding managers who consistently provide accurate estimates.
Participative Budgeting
Most people will perform better and make greater attempts to achieve a goal if they have
been consulted in setting the goal. The idea of p articipative budgeting is to involve
employees throughout an organization in the budgetary process. Such participation can
give employees the feeling that “this is our budget,” rather than the all-too-common
feeling that “this is the budget you imposed on us.”
While participative budgeting can be very effective, it also can have shortcomings.
Too much participation and discussion can lead to vacillation and delay. Also, when those
involved in the budgeting process disagree in significant and irreconcilable ways, the
process of participation can accentuate those differences. Finally, the problem of budget
padding can be severe unless incentives for accurate projections are provided.

Chapter 9 Profit Planning and Activity-Based Budgeting 377
Chapter Summary
LO1 List and explain five purposes of budgeting systems. The budget is a key tool for planning,
control, and decision making in virtually every organization. The five purposes of budgeting systems
are: to force planning, to facilitate communication and coordination, to allocate resources, to control
profit and operations, and to evaluate performance and provide incentives.
LO2 Describe the similarities and differences in the operational budgets prepared by manufac-
turers, service industry firms, merchandisers, and nonprofit organizations. The key difference in
the operational budgets of manufacturers and merchandisers versus service-industry and nonprofit orga-
nizations is that the operational budgets of manufacturers and merchandisers must account for the pro-
duction or purchase and holding of inventory. In contrast, the budgets of service-industry and nonprofit
organizations generally do not have inventories of manufactured or purchased inventories.
LO3 Explain the concept of activity-based budgeting and the benefits it brings to the budgeting
process. Activity-based budgeting (ABB) applies the concepts of activity-based costing (ABC) to the
budgeting process. Utilizing ABC information in the budgeting process through ABB provides sound
information for budgeting costs, because the underlying ABC information is based explicitly on the
relationships among cost drivers, activities, and resources consumed.
LO4 Prepare each of the budget schedules that make up the master budget. As shown in the chap-
ter, the master budget includes the following key budget schedules: sales; production; direct-material;
direct-labor; manufacturing overhead; selling, general, and administrative expense; cash receipts; cash
disbursements; cash; and the cost of goods manufactured and sold. Also included are the following bud-
geted financial statements: income statement; statement of cash flows; and balance sheet.
LO5 Discuss the role of assumptions and predictions in budgeting. A master budget is based on
many assumptions and predictions of unknown parameters. Some estimates tend to be quite accurate,
while other predictions are much more difficult.
LO6 Describe a typical organization’s process of budget administration. Most organizations have
a well-defined process by which budget data is collected and the budget is prepared. This administra-
tive process often includes a budget director or chief budget officer, a budget manual, and a budgeting
committee.
LO7 Understand the importance of budgeting product life-cycle costs. A relatively recent focus of
the budgeting process is to plan for product life-cycle costs. A large portion of these costs often are com-
mitted early in a product’s life cycle. It is important for management to be fairly certain that the revenue
to be generated by a product will cover all of its life-cycle costs.
LO8 Discuss the behavioral implications of budgetary slack and participative budgeting. A com-
mon problem in budgeting is the tendency of people to pad budgets. The resulting budgetary slack
makes the budget less useful because the padded budget does not present an accurate picture of expected
revenue and expenses. Participative budgeting is the process of allowing employees throughout the orga-
nization to have a significant role in developing the budget. Participative budgeting can result in greater
commitment to meet the budget by those who participated in the process.

expected to be $100,000 (4,000 units).
• SolarTech desires to have 10 percent of the following quarter’s sales needs in finished-goods
inventory at the end of each quarter. (On December 31, 20x7, SolarTech expects to have 200 units
in inventory.)
• Each tile requires two pounds of raw material. SolarTech desires to have 10 percent of the next
quarter’s raw material in inventory at the end of each quarter. (On December 31, 20x7, SolarTech
expects to have 480 pounds of raw material in inventory.)
• The raw material price is $5 per pound. The company buys its raw material on account and pays
70 percent of the resulting accounts payable during the quarter of the purchase. The remaining
30 percent is paid during the following quarter. (The raw-material purchases in the fourth quarter of
20x7 are expected to be $36,600.)
Required: Prepare the following budget schedules for 20x8. Include a column for each quarter and
for the year.
1. Sales budget (in units and dollars).
2. Cash receipts budget.
3. Production budget.
4. Direct material budget. (H int: The desired ending inventory in the fourth quarter is 480 pounds.)

† The desired ending raw material inventory for the fourth quarter of 20x8 is given at 480 pounds. However, it can also be computed indepen-
dently by noting that the expected sales pattern for 20x9 is the same as that for 20x8. Therefore, the first quarter budgets for 20x9 will be
the same as those for the first quarter of 20x8. So the desired ending raw-material inventory for the fourth quarter of 20x8 is 480 pounds
(10% " 4,800 pounds required for production in the first quarter of 20x9.)

which the bank operates has been growing, and the bank has experienced a 10 percent increase in its
number of bank accounts over each of the past five years. In 20x1, the bank had 10,000 accounts.
The new accounts manager is paid a salary plus a bonus of $15 for every new account she gener-
ates above the budgeted amount. Thus, if the annual budget calls for 500 new accounts, and 540 new
accounts are obtained, Williams’s bonus will be $600 (40 " $15).
Williams believes the economy of the county will continue to grow at the same rate in 20x2 as it
has in recent years. She has decided to submit a budgetary projection of 700 new accounts for 20x2.

• The purchase of electronic components is Alpha-Tech’s largest expenditure, and each month’s
cost of goods sold is estimated to be 40 percent of sales. Seventy percent of the parts are
received by Alpha-Tech one month prior to sale, and 30 percent are received during the month
of sale.
• Historically, 75 percent of accounts payable has been paid one month after receipt of the purchased
components, and the remaining 25 percent has been paid two months after receipt.
• Hourly wages and fringe benefits, estimated to be 30 percent of the current month’s sales, are paid
in the month incurred.
• General and administrative expenses are projected to be $15,620,000 for the year. The breakdown
of these expenses is presented in the following schedule. All cash expenditures are paid uniformly
throughout the year, except the property taxes, which are paid in four equal installments at the end
of each quarter.

• Income-tax payments are made at the beginning of each calendar quarter based on the income of
the prior quarter. Alpha-Tech is subject to an income-tax rate of 40 percent. Alpha-Tech’s operating
income for the first quarter of 20x5 is projected to be $3,200,000. The company pays 100 percent
of the estimated tax payment.
• Alpha-Tech maintains a minimum cash balance of $500,000. If the cash balance is less than
$500,000 at the end of each month, the company borrows amounts necessary to maintain this bal-
ance. All amounts borrowed are repaid out of the subsequent positive cash flow. The projected
April 1, 20x5, opening balance is $500,000.
• Alpha-Tech has no short-term debt as of April 1, 20x5.
• Alpha-Tech uses a calendar year for both financial reporting and tax purposes.
Required:
1. Prepare a cash budget for Alpha-Tech by month for the second quarter of 20x5. For simplicity,
ignore any interest expense associated with borrowing.
2. Discuss why cash budgeting is important for Alpha-Tech.

increased sharply in 20x1, and bonuses were paid to the management staff for the first time in several

years. Bonuses are based in part on the amount by which reported income exceeds budgeted income.
Budgetary Constraints
Jim Kern, vice president of finance, was pleased with TCC’s 20x1 earnings and thought that the
(LO 4, 5, 7)
pressure to show financial results would ease. However, Ellen North, TCC’s president, told Kern that she
saw no reason why the 20x2 bonuses should not be double those of 20x1. As a result, Kern felt pressure
to increase reported income in order to exceed budgeted income by an even greater amount. This would
assure increased bonuses.
Kern met with Bill Keller of Pristeel, Inc., a primary vendor of TCC’s manufacturing supplies
and equipment. Kern and Keller have been close business contacts for many years. Kern asked Keller
to identify all of TCC’s purchases of perishable supplies as equipment on Pristeel’s sales invoices. The
reason Kern gave for his request was that TCC’s president had imposed stringent budget constraints on
operating expenses but not on capital expenditures. Kern planned to capitalize the purchase of perishable
supplies, and include them with the Equipment account on the balance sheet. In this way Kern could

defer the expense recognition for these items to a later year. This procedure would increase reported
earnings, leading to increased bonuses. Keller agreed to do as Kern had asked.
While analyzing the second quarter financial statements, Gary Wood, TCC’s controller, noticed a
large decrease in supplies expense from one year ago. Wood reviewed the Supplies Expense account
and noticed that only equipment and no supplies had been purchased from Pristeel, a major source for
supplies. Wood, who reports to Kern, immediately brought this to Kern’s attention.
Kern told Wood of North’s high expectations and of the arrangement made with Keller of Pristeel.
Wood told Kern that his action was an improper accounting treatment for the supplies purchased from
Pristeel. Wood requested that he be allowed to correct the accounts and urged that the arrangement with
Pristeel be discontinued. Kern refused the request and told Wood not to become involved in the arrange-
ment with Pristeel.
After clarifying the situation in a confidential discussion with an objective and qualified peer
within TCC, Wood arranged to meet with North, TCC’s president. At the meeting, Wood disclosed the
arrangement Kern had made with Pristeel.
Required:
1. Explain why the use of alternative accounting methods to manipulate reported earnings is unethical.
2. Is Gary Wood, TCC’s controller, correct in saying that the supplies purchased from Pristeel, Inc.
were accounted for improperly? Explain your answer.
3. Assuming that Jim Kern’s arrangement with Pristeel, Inc. was in violation of the standards of ethi-
cal conduct for managerial accountants, discuss whether the actions of Wood were appropriate or
inappropriate. (The standards are given in Chapter 1.)

Howell will reflect the following information in his revised forecast for the fourth quarter.
• Toronto Business Associates currently has 25 consultants on staff, 10 for management consulting
and 15 for computer systems consulting. Three additional management consultants have been hired
to start work at the beginning of the fourth quarter in order to meet the increased client demand.
• The hourly billing rate for consulting revenue will remain at $90 per hour for each management
consultant and $75 per hour for each computer consultant. However, due to the favorable increase
in billing hour volume when compared to the plan, the hours for each consultant will be increased
by 50 hours per quarter.
• The budgeted annual salaries and actual annual salaries, paid monthly, are the same: $50,000 for
a management consultant and $46,000 for a computer consultant. Corporate management has
approved a merit increase of 10 percent at the beginning of the fourth quarter for all 25 existing
consultants, while the new consultants will be compensated at the planned rate.
• The planned salary expense includes a provision for employee fringe benefits amounting to 30 per-
cent of the annual salaries. However, the improvement of some corporatewide employee programs
will increase the fringe benefits to 40 percent.
• The original plan assumes a fixed hourly rate for travel and other related expenses for each billing
hour of consulting. These are expenses that are not reimbursed by the client, and the previously
determined hourly rate has proven to be adequate to cover these costs.
• Other revenue is derived from temporary rentals and interest income and remains unchanged for the
fourth quarter.
• General and administrative expenses have been favorable at 7 percent below the plan; this 7 percent
savings on fourth quarter expenses will be reflected in the revised plan.
• Depreciation of office equipment and personal computers will stay constant at the projected
straight-line rate.
• Due to the favorable experience for the first three quarters and the division’s increased ability
to absorb costs, the corporate management at Maple Leaf Services has increased the corporate
expense allocation by 50 percent.
Required:
1. Prepare a revised operating budget for the fourth quarter for Toronto Business Associates that
Richard Howell will present to corporate management.
2. Discuss the reasons why an organization would prepare a revised operating budget.

Healthful Foods Inc., a manufacturer of breakfast cereals and snack bars, has experienced several years of

steady growth in sales, profits, and dividends while maintaining a relatively low level of debt. The board
Objectives; Ethics
of directors has adopted a long-run strategy to maximize the value of the shareholders’ investment. In
(LO 1, 2, 4)
order to achieve this goal, the board of directors established the following five-year financial objectives.
2. Increase in sales: 11.5%
• Increase sales by 12 percent per year.
• Increase income before taxes by 15 percent per year.
• Maintain long-term debt at a maximum of 16 percent of assets.
These financial objectives have been attained for the past three years. At the beginning of last year,
the president of Healthful Foods, Andrea Donis, added a fourth financial objective of maintaining cost
of goods sold at a maximum of 70 percent of sales. This goal also was attained last year.
The budgeting process at Healthful Foods is to be directed toward attaining these goals for the
forthcoming year, a difficult task with the economy in a prolonged recession. In addition, the increased
emphasis on eating healthful foods has driven up the price of ingredients used by the company sig-
nificantly faster than the expected rate of inflation. John Winslow, cost accountant at Healthful Foods,
has responsibility for preparation of the profit plan for next year. Winslow assured Donis that he could
present a budget that achieved all of the financial objectives. Winslow believed that he could overesti-
mate the ending inventory and reclassify fruit and grain inspection costs as administrative rather than
manufacturing costs to attain the desired objective. The actual statements for 20x1 and the budgeted
statements for 20x2 that Winslow prepared are as follows:

Jack Hanson, the assistant controller, is now preparing a monthly budget for the first quarter of
20x1. In the process, the following information has been accumulated:
1. Projected sales for December of 20x0 are $400,000. Credit sales typically are 75 percent of total
sales. Intercoastal’s credit experience indicates that 10 percent of the credit sales are collected dur-
ing the month of sale, and the remainder are collected during the following month.
2. Intercoastal’s cost of goods sold generally runs at 70 percent of sales. Inventory is purchased
on account, and 40 percent of each month’s purchases are paid during the month of purchase.
The remainder is paid during the following month. In order to have adequate stocks of inventory
on hand, the firm attempts to have inventory at the end of each month equal to half of the next
month’s projected cost of goods sold.
3. Hanson has estimated that Intercoastal’s other monthly expenses will be as follows:
Sales salaries .............................................................................................................................................. $21,000
Advertising and promotion ............................................................................................................................ 16,000
Administrative salaries ................................................................................................................................. 21,000
Depreciation ................................................................................................................................................ 25,000
Interest on bonds ......................................................................................................................................... 2,500
Property taxes .............................................................................................................................................. 900
In addition, sales commissions run at the rate of 1 percent of sales.

4. Intercoastal’s president, Davies-Lowry, has indicated that the firm should invest $125,000 in an
automated inventory-handling system to control the movement of inventory in the firm’s ware-
house just after the new year begins. These equipment purchases will be financed primarily from
the firm’s cash and marketable securities. However, Davies-Lowry believes that Intercoastal needs
to keep a minimum cash balance of $25,000. If necessary, the remainder of the equipment pur-
chases will be financed using short-term credit from a local bank. The minimum period for such
a loan is three months. Hanson believes short-term interest rates will be 10 percent per year at the
time of the equipment purchases. If a loan is necessary, Davies-Lowry has decided it should be
paid off by the end of the first quarter if possible.
5. Intercoastal’s board of directors has indicated an intention to declare and pay dividends of $50,000
on the last day of each quarter.
6. The interest on any short-term borrowing will be paid when the loan is repaid. Interest on Inter-
coastal’s bonds is paid semiannually on January 31 and July 31 for the preceding six-month
period.
7. Property taxes are paid semiannually on February 28 and August 31 for the preceding six-month
period.

Cases
! Case 9–46 City Racquetball Club (CRC) offers racquetball and other physical fitness facilities to its members.
Using Budgets to Evaluate There are four of these clubs in the metropolitan area. Each club has between 1,800 and 2,500 members.
Business Decisions Revenue is derived from annual membership fees and hourly court fees. The annual membership fees
(LO 1, 2, 5) are as follows:
Individual ................................................................................ $ 40
Student .................................................................................. 25
Family .................................................................................... 95
The hourly court fees vary from $6 to $10 depending upon the season and the time of day (prime versus
nonprime time).
The peak racquetball season is considered to run from September through April. During this
period, court usage averages 90 to 100 percent of capacity during prime time (5:00–9:00 p.m.) and 50
to 60 percent of capacity during the remaining hours. Daily court usage during the off-season (i.e., sum-
mer) averages only 20 to 40 percent of capacity.
Most of CRC’s memberships have September expirations. A substantial amount of the cash receipts
are collected during the early part of the racquetball season due to the renewal of the annual membership
fees and heavy court usage. However, cash receipts are not as large in the spring and drop significantly
in the summer months.
CRC is considering changing its membership and fee structure in an attempt to change its cash
receipts. Under the new membership plan, only an annual membership fee would be charged, rather than
a membership fee plus hourly court fees. There would be two classes of membership as follows:
Individual ............................................................................... $250
Family ................................................................................... 400
The annual fee would be collected in advance at the time the membership application is completed.
Members would be allowed to use the racquetball courts as often as they wish during the year under the
new plan.
All future memberships would be sold under these new terms. Current memberships would be
honored on the old basis until they expire. However, a special promotional campaign would be insti-
tuted to attract new members and to encourage current members to convert to the new membership plan
immediately.
The annual fees for individual and family memberships would be reduced to $200 and $300,
respectively, during the two-month promotional campaign. In addition, all memberships sold or renewed
during this period would be for 15 months rather than the normal one-year period. Current members also
would be given a credit toward the annual fee for the unexpired portion of their membership fee, and for
all prepaid hourly court fees for league play that have not yet been used.
CRC’s management estimates that 60 to 70 percent of the present membership would continue with
the club. The most active members (45 percent of the present membership) would convert immediately
to the new plan, while the remaining members who continue would wait until their current memberships
expire. Those members who would not continue are not considered active (i.e., they play five or less
times during the year). Management estimates that the loss of members would be offset fully by new
members within six months of instituting the new plan. Furthermore, many of the new members would
be individuals who would play during nonprime time. Management estimates that adequate court time
will be available for all members under the new plan.
If the new membership plan is adopted, it would be instituted on February 1, well before the sum-
mer season. The special promotional campaign would be conducted during March and April. Once the
plan is implemented, annual renewal of memberships and payment of fees would take place as each
individual or family membership expires.

! Case 9–47
Patrica Eklund, controller in the division of social services for the state, recognizes the importance of the
Participative Budgeting
budgetary process for planning, control, and motivational purposes. She believes that a properly imple-
(LO 1, 2, 8)
mented participative budgetary process for planning purposes and an evaluation procedure will motivate
the managers to improve productivity within their particular departments. Based upon this philosophy,
Eklund has implemented the following budgetary procedures.
• An appropriation target figure is given to each department manager. This amount is the maximum
funding that each department can expect to receive in the next year.
• Department managers develop their individual budgets within the following spending constraints as
directed by the controller’s staff.
• Expenditure requests cannot exceed the appropriation target.
• All fixed expenditures should be included in the budget. Fixed expenditures would include such
items as contracts and salaries at current levels.
• All government projects directed by higher authority should be included in the budget in their
entirety.
• The controller’s staff consolidates the budget requests from the various departments into a master
budget submission for the entire division.
• Upon final budget approval by the legislature, the controller’s staff allocates the appropriation to
the various departments on instructions from the division manager. However, a specified percentage
of each department’s appropriation is held back in anticipation of potential budget cuts and special
funding needs. The amount and use of this contingency fund is left to the discretion of the division
manager.
• Each department is allowed to adjust its budget when necessary to operate within the reduced
appropriation level. However, as stated in the original directive, specific projects authorized by
higher authority must remain intact.
• The final budget is used as the basis of control. Excessive expenditures by account for each depart-
ment are highlighted on a monthly basis. Department managers are expected to account for all
expenditures over budget. Fiscal responsibility is an important factor in the overall performance
evaluation of department managers.
Eklund believes her policy of allowing the department managers to participate in the budgetary
process and then holding them accountable for their performance is essential, especially during times
of limited resources. She further believes that the department managers will be positively motivated to
increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their departments because they have provided input into the
initial budgetary process and are required to justify any unfavorable performances.
Required:
1. Describe several operational and behavioral benefits that are generally attributed to a participative
budgetary process.
2. Identify at least four deficiencies in Patricia Eklund’s participative policy for planning and perfor-
mance evaluation purposes. For each deficiency identified, recommend how it can be corrected.

E
x 2. Frame-It’s sales history indicates that 60 percent of all sales are on credit, with the remainder of
the sales in cash. The company’s collection experience shows that 80 percent of the credit sales are
collected during the quarter in which the sale is made, while the remaining 20 percent is collected
in the following quarter. (For simplicity, assume the company is able to collect 100 percent of its
accounts receivable.)
3. The S frame sells for $10, and the L frame sells for $15. These prices are expected to hold constant
throughout 20x1.
4. Frame-It’s production manager attempts to end each quarter with enough finished-goods inventory
in each product line to cover 20 percent of the following quarter’s sales. Moreover, an attempt is
made to end each quarter with 20 percent of the glass sheets needed for the following quarter’s
production. Since metal strips are purchased locally, Frame-It buys them on a just-in-time basis;
inventory is negligible.
5. All of Frame-It’s direct-material purchases are made on account, and 80 percent of each quarter’s
purchases are paid in cash during the same quarter as the purchase. The other 20 percent is paid in
the next quarter.

FOCUS COMPANY >>>
THIS CHAPTER’S FOCUS COMPANY is D Cdesserts.com, which supplies
fancy desserts to a variety of restaurants, caterers, and upscale food stores
in Washington, D.C. The company’s order-taking system is entirely Web-based. Each day,
DCdesserts.com posts its dessert menu on its Web site, and orders are accepted via the Inter-
net. In this chapter, we explore D Cdesserts
.com ’s use of standard costing. A standard-
costing system sets predetermined (or
standard) costs for each of a product’s
inputs, such as direct material and
direct labor. Then the actual costs to
produce the product are compared
with the standard costs that should
have been incurred. DCdesserts.com’ s
management uses the standard-costing sys-
tem to help control the company’s production costs.

In contrast to the food-processing setting of DCdesserts.com, we
will turn our attention to the financial-services industry. Here we will
explore Forest Home National Bank’s (FHNB) use of the balanced scorecard. FHNB’s
balanced scorecard helps management and employees focus on the customer, internal
operations, and learning and growth areas of the business, so that ultimately the bank’s
long-term financial goals will be attained.

A budget provides a plan for managers to follow in making decisions and directing an
organization’s activities. At the end of a budget period, the budget serves another useful
purpose. At that time, managers use the budget as a benchmark against which to compare
the results of actual operations. Did the company make as much profit as anticipated in the
budget? Were costs greater or less than expected? These questions involve issues of cost
management and control. In this chapter, we will study one of the tools used by manage-
rial accountants to assist managers in controlling an organization’s operations and costs.
Managing Costs
How can managers use a control system as a cost management tool? Any control system
Learning Objective 1
has three basic parts: a predetermined or standard performance level, a measure of actual
Explain how standard costing is performance, and a c omparison between standard and actual performance. A thermostat is
used to help manage costs. a control system with which we are all familiar. First, a thermostat has a predetermined or
standard temperature, which can be set at any desired level. If you want the temperature in a
room to be 68 degrees, you set the thermostat at the s tandard of 68 degrees. Second, the ther-
mostat has a thermometer, which measures the actual temperature in the room. Third, the
thermostat compares the preset or standard temperature with the actual room temperature.
If the actual temperature falls below the preset or standard temperature, the thermostat acti-
vates a heating device. The three features of a control system are depicted in Exhibit 10–1 .
A managerial accountant’s budgetary-control system works like a thermostat. First,
a predetermined or standard cost is set. In essence, a standard cost is a budget for the
production of one unit of product or service. It is the cost chosen by the managerial

accountant to serve as the benchmark in the budgetary-control system. When the
firm produces many units, the managerial accountant uses the standard unit cost to
determine the total standard or budgeted cost of production. For example, suppose the
standard direct-material cost for one unit of product is $5 and 100 units are manufac-
tured. The total standard or budgeted direct-material cost, given an actual output of
100 units, is $500 ($5 " 100).
Second, the managerial accountant measures the actual cost incurred in the produc-
tion process.
Third, the managerial accountant compares the actual cost with the budgeted or stan-
dard cost. Any difference between the two is called a cost variance . Cost variances then
are used in controlling costs.
Management by Exception
Managers are busy people. They do not have time to look into the causes of every vari-
ance between actual and standard costs. However, they do take the time to investigate
the causes of significant cost variances. This process of following up on only significant
cost variances is called management by exception . When operations are going along as
planned, actual costs and profit will typically be close to the budgeted amounts. How-
ever, if there are significant departures from planned operations, such effects will show
up as significant cost variances. Managers investigate these variances to determine their
causes, if possible, and take corrective action when indicated.
What constitutes a significant variance? No precise answer can be given to this ques-
tion, since it depends on the size and type of the organization and its production process.
We will consider this issue later in the chapter when we discuss common methods for
determining the significance of cost variances. First, however, we will turn our attention
to the process of setting standards.
Setting Standards
Methods for Setting Standards
Managerial accountants typically use two methods for setting cost standards: analysis of

historical data and task analysis.
Describe two ways to set
Analysis of Historical Data One indicator of future costs is historical cost data. standards and distinguish

torical costs can provide a good basis for predicting future costs. The methods for analyz-
ing cost behavior that we studied in Chapter 6 are used in making cost predictions. The
managerial accountant often will need to adjust these predictions to reflect movements in
price levels or technological changes in the production process. For example, the amount

of rubber required to manufacture a particular type of tire will likely be the same this year
as last year, unless there has been a significant change in the process used to manufacture
tires. However, the price of rubber is likely to be different this year than last, and this fact
must be reflected in the new standard cost of a tire.
Despite the relevance of historical cost data in setting cost standards, managerial
accountants must guard against relying on them excessively. Even a seemingly minor
change in the way a product is manufactured may make historical data almost totally
irrelevant. Moreover, new products also require new cost standards. For new prod-
ucts, such as genetically engineered medicines, there are no historical cost data upon
which to base standards. In such cases, the managerial accountant must turn to another
approach.
Task Analysis Another way to set cost standards is to analyze the process of manu-
facturing a product to determine what it should cost. The emphasis shifts from what the
product d id cost in the past to what it should cost in the future. In using task analysis , the
managerial accountant typically works with engineers who are intimately familiar with
the production process. Together they conduct studies to determine exactly how much
direct material should be required and how machinery should be used in the production
process. Time and motion studies are conducted to determine how long each step per-
formed by direct laborers should take.
A Combined Approach Managerial accountants often apply both historical cost
analysis and task analysis in setting cost standards. It may be, for example, that the tech-
nology has changed for only one step in the production process. In such a case, the mana-
gerial accountant would work with engineers to set cost standards for the technologically
changed part of the production process. However, the accountant would likely rely on the
less expensive method of analyzing historical cost data to update the cost standards for
the remainder of the production process.
Participation in Setting Standards
Standards should not be determined by the managerial accountant alone. People
generally will be more committed to meeting standards if they are allowed to partici-
pate in setting them. For example, production supervisors should have a role in setting
production cost standards, and sales managers should be involved in setting targets for
sales prices and volume. In addition, knowledgeable staff personnel should participate
in the standard-setting process. For example, task analysis should be carried out by
a team consisting of production engineers, production supervisors, and managerial
accountants.
Perfection versus Practical Standards: A Behavioral Issue
How difficult should it be to attain standard costs? Should standards be set so that actual
costs rarely exceed standard costs? Or should it be so hard to attain standards that actual
costs frequently exceed them? The answers to these questions depend on the purpose for
which standards will be used and how standards affect behavior.
Perfection Standards A p erfection (o r ideal) standard is one that can be attained
only under nearly perfect operating conditions. Such standards assume peak efficiency,
the lowest possible input prices, the best-quality materials obtainable, and no disrup-
tions in production due to such causes as machine breakdowns or power failures. Some
managers believe that perfection standards motivate employees to achieve the lowest cost
possible. They claim that since the standard is theoretically attainable, employees will
have an incentive to come as close as possible to achieving it.

================================================================================

Chapter 10 Standard Costing, Operational Performance Measures, and the Balanced Scorecard 409
Other managers and many behavioral scientists disagree. They feel that perfection
standards discourage employees, since they are so unlikely to be attained. Moreover,
setting unrealistically difficult standards may encourage employees to sacrifice product
quality to achieve lower costs. By skimping on raw-material quality or the attention given
manual production tasks, employees may be able to lower the production cost. However,
this lower cost may come at the expense of a higher rate of defective units. Thus, the firm
ultimately may incur higher costs than necessary as defective products are returned by
customers or scrapped upon inspection.
Practical Standards Standards that are as tight as practical, but still are expected
to be attained, are called p ractical (or a ttainable) standards . Such standards assume a “At Best Foods, standard

amounts of raw-material waste. Attaining a practical standard keeps employees on their Best Foods
toes, without demanding miracles. Most behavioral theorists believe that practical standards (a subsidiary of Unilever)
encourage more positive and productive employee attitudes than do perfection standards.
Use of Standards by Service Organizations
Many service industry firms, nonprofit organizations, and
governmental units make use of standards. For example,
FedEx allows its crews 18 minutes to unload the 9 to 12
containers of packages from a Boeing 727. A delay of
over a minute must be explained at a daily 5 a.m. meet-
ing. B urger King sets a standard for the amount of meat
in a hamburger. Airlines such as American or United set
standards for fuel and maintenance costs. Insurance com-
panies such as A llstate or S tate Farm set standards for
the amount of time to process an insurance application.
Even a county motor vehicle office may have a standard
for the number of days required to process and return an
application for vehicle registration. These and similar
organizations use standards in budgeting and cost control
Insurance companies use standards to manage how long it

takes to underwrite a new policy or settle a claim.

To illustrate the use of standards in managing costs, we will focus on a producer of
fancy desserts located in the Washington, D.C., area. DCdesserts.com supplies fresh
and frozen desserts to a variety of restaurants, caterers, and upscale food stores. The
company’s order-taking system is entirely Web-based. DCdesserts.com posts its menu
of fresh fancy dessert products for each day on its website four days in advance of the
delivery date. Orders are accepted via the Internet three days in advance of delivery. For
example, the menu of desserts to be available for delivery on Friday afternoon is posted

DCdesserts.com also produces frozen dessert products for upscale grocery stores.
Unlike the fresh desserts, which vary daily, the frozen desserts are stock items that
are varied less frequently. Like the fresh desserts, however, the frozen dessert menu is
posted to DCdesserts.com ’s website, and orders are accepted entirely via the Internet.

DCdesserts.com produces its fresh fancy desserts and frozen desserts in two different
production facilities, both located near the Washington beltway.
The production process for the fresh fancy desserts involves a combination of semiau-
tomated equipment and manual labor. Even in this era of widespread automation, making
fancy desserts still involves considerable direct labor. In the words of DCdesserts.com ’s
founder and owner, “making a Black Forest cake or a Linzer torte to be served in the U.S.
Senate dining room is not the same as making your basic pumpkin pie. There’s a lot of touch
labor by skilled people in doing these fancy desserts.” The basic steps in the production pro-
cess are much as you might expect. These steps include selecting ingredients, mixing, bak-
ing, cooling, and finishing. The finishing work, of course, involves the most skilled direct
labor. In making a six-layer chocolate raspberry cake, for example, each individual cake
layer must be sliced into two pieces, and then fillings and icings are spread on each layer.
The cake’s top is finished artistically, and any additional toppings are carefully applied.
DCdesserts.com ’s director of cost management has set standards for direct material
and direct labor as follows for a category of dessert products generically referred to as
multilayer fancy cakes.
Direct-Material Standards
The standard quantity and price of ingredients for one multilayer fancy cake, such as a
Black Forest cake, are shown in the following table:
Standard quantity:
Ingredients in finished product ............................................................................................................ 4.75 pounds
Allowance for normal waste ................................................................................................................ .25 pound
Total standard quantity required per multilayer fancy cake .................................................................... 5.00 pounds
Standard price:
Purchase price per pound of ingredients (net of purchase discounts) ..................................................... $1.30
Transportation cost per pound ............................................................................................................. .10
Total standard price per pound of ingredients ....................................................................................... $1.40
The standard quantity of ingredients needed to produce one cake is 5 pounds, even
though only 4.75 pounds actually remain in the finished product. One-quarter pound of ingre-
dients is wasted as a normal result of the production process. Therefore, the entire amount of
ingredients needed to produce a fancy cake is included in the standard quantity of material.
The standard price of ingredients reflects all of the costs incurred to acquire the
material and transport it to the plant. Notice that the cost of transportation is added to the
purchase price. Any purchase discounts would be subtracted out from the purchase price
to obtain a net price.
To summarize, the s tandard direct-material quantity is the total amount of direct
material normally required to produce a finished product, including allowances for nor-
mal waste or inefficiency. The s tandard direct-material price is the total delivered cost,
after subtracting any purchase discounts.
Direct-Labor Standards
The standard quantity and rate for direct labor for the production of one multilayer fancy
cake are as follows:
Standard quantity:
Direct labor required per multilayer fancy cake ....................................................................................... .5 hour
Standard rate:
Hourly wage rate ................................................................................................................................... $16
Fringe benefits (25% of wages) ............................................................................................................. 4
Total standard rate per hour ................................................................................................................... $20

================================================================================
PAGE 446
================================================================================

Chapter 10 Standard Costing, Operational Performance Measures, and the Balanced Scorecard 411
The s tandard direct-labor quantity is the number of direct-labor hours normally
needed to manufacture one unit of product. The standard direct-labor rate is the total
hourly cost of compensation, including fringe benefits.
Standard Costs Given Actual Output
During September, DCdesserts.com produced 2,000 multilayer fancy cakes. The
total standard or budgeted costs for direct material and direct labor are computed as
follows:
Direct material:
Standard direct-material cost per cake (5 pounds " $1.40 per pound) .......................................................... $ 7
Actual output .............................................................................................................................................. " 2,000
Total standard direct-material cost ............................................................................................................... $14,000
Direct labor:
Direct-labor cost per cake (.5 hour " $20.00 per hour) ................................................................................ $ 10
Actual output .............................................................................................................................................. " 2,000
Total standard direct-labor cost .................................................................................................................... $20,000
Notice that the total standard cost for the direct-material and direct-labor inputs
is based on DCdesserts.com ’s actual o utput. The company should incur costs of
$34,000 for direct material and direct labor, given that it produced 2,000 multilayer
fancy cakes. The total standard costs for direct material and direct labor serve as the
managerial accountant’s benchmarks against which to compare actual costs. This
comparison then serves as the basis for controlling direct-material and direct-labor
costs.
Analysis of Cost Variances
During September, DCdesserts.com incurred the following actual costs for direct mate-
rial and direct labor in the production of multilayer fancy cakes.
Direct material purchased: actual cost 12,500 pounds at $1.42 per pound ......................................................... $17,750
Direct material used: actual cost 10,250 pounds at $1.42 per pound .................................................................. $14,555
Direct labor: actual cost 980 hours at $21 per hour ........................................................................................... $20,580
Compare these actual expenditures with the total standard costs for the produc-
tion of 2,000 multilayer fancy cakes. DCdesserts.com spent more than the budgeted
amount for both direct material and direct labor. But why were these excess costs
incurred? Is there any further analysis the managerial accountant can provide to help
answer this question?
Direct-Material Variances
What caused DCdesserts.com to spend more than the anticipated amount on direct
material? First, the company purchased ingredients at a higher price ($1.42 per pound)
than the standard price ($1.40 per pound). Second, the company used more ingredients
than the standard amount. The amount actually used was 10,250 pounds instead of the
standard amount of 10,000 pounds, which is based on actual output of 2,000 multilayer
fancy cakes. The managerial accountant can show both of these deviations from stan-
dards by computing a d irect-material price variance ( or p urchase price variance) and
a direct-material quantity variance . The computation of these variances is depicted in
Exhibit 10–2 .

For the direct-material

quantity must be based on a ctual output. Then the quantity variance compares the follow-
ing two quantities.
Direct-Labor Variances
Why did DCdesserts.com spend more than the anticipated amount on direct labor during
September? First, the division incurred a cost of $21 per hour for direct labor instead
of the standard amount of $20 per hour. Second, the division used only 980 hours of
direct labor, which is less than the standard quantity of 1,000 hours, given actual output
of 2,000 multilayer fancy cakes. The managerial accountant analyzes direct-labor costs
by computing a direct-labor rate variance and a d irect-labor efficiency variance .
Exhibit 10–3 depicts the computation of these variances.

PARKER HANNIFIN CORPORATION’S BRASS PRODUCTS DIVISION A ccounting
Parker Hannifin ’s Brass Products Division, a world-class manufacturer of brass fittings, P ractice
valves, and tubing, is a standard-costing success story. 1 “Parker Brass uses its standard-
Parker Hannifin
costing system and variance analyses as important business tools to target problem
areas so it can develop solutions for continuous improvement. Variances are reported for
each product line, and if any production variance exceeds 5 percent of product-line sales,
the product-line manager is required to provide an explanation. Also required is a plan
to correct the problems underlying any unfavorable variances. Variance reports, which
are generated within one day of the completion of a job order, are distributed to manag-
ers and production schedulers. A variance database is kept, which can be accessed by
product-line managers, to provide variance data by part number, by job-order number, or
by dollar amount.”
From the perspective of Parker Brass’s management, the division has modified its
standard-costing system to provide disaggregated and timely cost information to enable
timely corrective action in a rapidly changing business environment.
Multiple Types of Direct Material or Direct Labor
Manufacturing processes usually involve several types of direct material. In such cases,
direct-material price and quantity variances are computed for each type of material. Then these
variances are added to obtain a total price variance and a total quantity variance, as follows:
Price Variance Quantity Variance
Direct material A ......................................................................................... $1,000 F $1,600 U
Direct material B ......................................................................................... 2,500 U 200 U
Direct material C ......................................................................................... 800 U 500 F
Total variance ............................................................................................. $2,300 U $1,300 U
Similarly, if a production process involves several types of direct labor, rate and efficiency
variances are computed for each labor type. Then they are added to obtain a total rate
variance and a total efficiency variance.
Allowing for Spoilage or Defects
In some manufacturing processes, a certain amount of spoilage or defective production
is normal. This must be taken into account when the standard quantity of material is
computed. To illustrate, suppose that 100 gallons of chemicals are normally required in
a chemical process in order to obtain 80 gallons of good output. If total good output in
January is 500 gallons, what is the standard allowed quantity of input?1

cost variances. These questions are difficult to answer, because to some extent the answers are
part of the art of management. A manager applies judgment and experience in making
guesses, pursuing hunches, and relying on intuition to determine when a variance should
be investigated. Nevertheless, there are guidelines and rules of thumb that managers
often apply.
Size of Variances The absolute size of a variance is one consideration. Managers
are more likely to follow up on large variances than on small ones. The relative size of
the variance is probably even more important. A manager is more likely to investigate
a $20,000 material quantity variance that is 20 percent of the standard direct-material
cost of $100,000 than a $50,000 labor efficiency variance that is only 2 percent of the
standard direct-labor cost of $2,500,000. The r elative magnitude of the $20,000 material
quantity variance (20 percent) is greater than the r elative magnitude of the $50,000 labor
efficiency variance (2 percent). For this reason, managerial accountants often show the
relative magnitude of variances in their cost variance reports. For example, the September
cost variance report for DCdesserts.com ’s production of multilayer fancy cakes is shown
in Exhibit 10–4 .
Managers often apply a rule of thumb that takes into account both the absolute and
the relative magnitudes of a variance. An example of such a rule is the following: Inves-
tigate variances that are either greater than $10,000 or greater than 10 percent of standard
cost.
Recurring Variances Another consideration in deciding when to investigate a
variance is whether the variance occurs repeatedly or only infrequently. Suppose a man-
ager uses the rule of thumb stated above and direct-material quantity variances occur as
shown in the following Excel spreadsheet.
A strict adherence to the rule of thumb indicates no investigation, since none of the
monthly variances is greater than $10,000 or 10 percent of standard cost. Nevertheless,
the manager might investigate this variance in April, since it has r ecurred at a reasonably
high level for several consecutive months. In this case, the consistency of the variance
triggers an investigation, not its absolute or relative magnitude.

Direct-labor rate variance ......................................................... 980 Unfavorable 4.9%
Direct-labor efficiency variance ................................................. 400 Favorable (2.0%)
Trends A trend in a variance also may call for investigation. Suppose a manager
observes the direct-labor efficiency variances shown in the following Excel spreadsheet.
None of these variances is large enough to trigger an investigation if the manager
uses the “$10,000 or 10 percent” rule of thumb. However, the four-month trend is wor-
risome. An alert manager will likely follow up on this unfavorable trend to determine its
causes before costs get out of hand.
Controllability Another important consideration in deciding when to look into the
causes of a variance is the manager’s view of the c ontrollability of the cost item. A man-
ager is more likely to investigate the variance for a cost that is controllable by someone in
the organization than one that is not. For example, there may be little point to investigat-
ing a material price variance if the organization has no control over the price. This could
happen, for example, if the firm has a long-term contract with a supplier of the material at
a price determined on the international market. In contrast, the manager is likely to follow
up on a variance that should be controllable, such as a direct-labor efficiency variance or
a direct-material quantity variance.
Favorable Variances It is just as important to investigate significant favorable
variances as significant unfavorable variances. For example, a favorable direct-labor
efficiency variance may indicate that employees have developed a more efficient way
of performing a production task. By investigating the variance, management can learn
about the improved method. It may be possible to use a similar approach elsewhere in
the organization.

418 Chapter 10 Standard Costing, Operational Performance Measures, and the Balanced Scorecard
Costs and Benefits of Investigation The decision whether to investigate a
cost variance is a cost-benefit decision. The costs of investigation include the time spent
by the investigating manager and the employees in the department where the investiga-
tion occurs. Other potential costs include disruption of the production process as the
investigation is conducted, and corrective actions taken to eliminate the cause of a vari-
ance. The benefits of a variance investigation include reduced future production costs if
the cause of an unfavorable variance is eliminated. Another potential benefit is the cost
saving associated with the lowering of cost standards when the cause of a favorable vari-
ance is discovered.
Weighing these considerations takes the judgment of skillful and experienced man-
agers. Key to this judgment is an intimate understanding of the organization’s production
process and day-to-day contact with its operations.
A Statistical Approach
There are many reasons for cost variances. For example, a direct-labor efficiency vari-
ance could be caused by inexperienced employees, employee inefficiency, poor-quality
raw materials, poorly maintained machinery, an intentional work slowdown due to
employee grievances, or many other factors. In addition to these substantive reasons,
there are purely random causes of variances. People are not robots, and they are not per-
fectly consistent in their work habits. Random fluctuations in direct-labor efficiency vari-
ances can be caused by such factors as employee illnesses, workers experimenting with
different production methods, or simply random fatigue. Ideally, managers would be able
to sort out the randomly caused variances from those with substantive and controllable
underlying causes. It is impossible to accomplish this with 100 percent accuracy, but a
statistical control chart can help.
A statistical control chart plots cost variances across time and compares them
with a statistically determined critical value that triggers an investigation. This criti-
cal value is usually determined by assuming that cost variances have a normal prob-
ability distribution with a mean of zero. The critical value is set at some multiple
of the distribution’s standard deviation. Variances greater than the critical value are
investigated.
Exhibit 10–5 shows a statistical control chart with a critical value of 1 standard devi-
ation. The manager would investigate the variance observed in May, since it falls further
than 1 standard deviation from the mean (zero). The variances for the remaining five
months would not be investigated. The presumption is that these minor variances are due
to random causes and are not worth investigating.

operations that underlie reported cost and profit numbers. Standard costs, budgets, and Describe some behavioral

performance of individuals, relative to standards or budgets, often is used to help deter-
mine salary increases, bonuses, and promotions. When standards and variances affect
employee reward structures, they can profoundly influence behavior.
For example, suppose a hotel’s food and beverage department manager earns a
bonus when food and beverage costs are below the budgeted amount. This reward
structure will provide a concrete incentive for the manager to keep food and beverage
costs under control. But such an incentive can have either positive or negative effects.
The bonus may induce the manager to seek the most economical food suppliers and
to watch more carefully for employee theft and waste. However, the bonus also could
persuade the manager to buy cheaper but less tender cuts of meat for the restaurant.
This could ultimately result in lost patronage for the restaurant and the hotel. One
aspect of skillful management is knowing how to use standards, budgets, and variances
to get the most out of an organization’s employees. Unfortunately, there are no simple
answers or formulas for success in this area. Despite such difficulties, standards, bud-
gets, and variances are used in the executive compensation schemes of many well-
known companies.
Controllability of Variances
Cost control is accomplished through the efforts of individual managers in an organiza-
tion. By determining which managers are in the best position to influence each cost vari-
ance, the managerial accountant can assist managers in deriving the greatest benefit from
cost variance analysis.
Who is responsible for the direct-material price and quantity variances? The
direct-labor rate and efficiency variances? Answering these questions is often difficult, “We designate variances as

controllable variances.” (10c)
Direct-Material Price Variance The purchasing manager is generally in the Best Foods
(a subsidiary of Unilever)
best position to influence material price variances. Through skillful purchasing practices,
an expert purchasing manager can get the best prices available for purchased goods and
services. To achieve this goal, the purchasing manager uses such practices as buying in
quantity, negotiating purchase contracts, comparing prices among vendors, and global
sourcing.
Despite these purchasing skills, the purchasing manager is not in complete control
of prices. The need to purchase component parts with precise engineering specifica-
tions, the all-too-frequent rush requests from the production department, and worldwide
shortages of critical materials all contribute to the challenges faced by the purchasing
manager.
Direct-Material Quantity Variance The production supervisor is usually in
the best position to influence material quantity variances. Skillful supervision and moti-
vation of production employees, coupled with the careful use and handling of materials,
contribute to minimal waste. Production engineers are also partially responsible for mate-
rial quantity variances, since they determine the grade and technical specifications of

420 Chapter 10 Standard Costing, Operational Performance Measures, and the Balanced Scorecard
materials and component parts. In some cases, using a low-grade material may result in
greater waste than using a high-grade material.
Direct-Labor Rate Variance Direct-labor rate variances generally result from
using a different mix of employees than that anticipated when the standards were set.
Wage rates differ among employees due to their skill levels and their seniority with the
organization. Using a higher proportion of more senior or more highly skilled employ-
ees than a task requires can result in unfavorable direct-labor rate variances. The pro-
duction supervisor is generally in the best position to influence the work schedules of
employees.
Direct-Labor Efficiency Variance Once again, the production supervisor is
usually most responsible for the efficient use of employee time. Through motivation
toward production goals and effective work schedules, the efficiency of employees can
be maximized.
Interaction among Variances
Interactions among variances often occur, making it even more difficult to determine
the responsibility for a particular variance. To illustrate, consider the following anecdote
from a manufacturer of brass musical instruments. The purchasing manager obtained a
special price on brass alloy from a new supplier. When the material was placed into pro-
duction, it turned out to be a lower grade of material than the production employees were
used to. The alloy was of a slightly different composition, which made the material bend
less easily during the formation of brass instruments. The company could have returned
the material to the supplier, but that would have interrupted production and kept the divi-
sion from filling its orders on time. Since using the off-standard material would not affect
the quality of the company’s finished products, the division manager decided to keep the
material and make the best of the situation.
The ultimate result was that the company incurred four interrelated variances during
May. The material was less expensive than normal, so the direct-material price variance
was favorable. However, the employees had difficulty using the material, which resulted
in more waste than expected. Hence, the division incurred an unfavorable direct-material
quantity variance.
What were the labor implications of the off-standard material? Due to the difficulty
in working with the metal alloy, the employees required more than the standard amount
of time to form the instruments. This resulted in an unfavorable direct-labor efficiency
variance. Finally, the production supervisor had to use his most senior employees to
work with the off-standard material. Since these people earned relatively high wages, the
direct-labor rate variance was also unfavorable.
To summarize, the purchase of off-standard material resulted in the following inter-
related variances.

Such interactions of variances make it more difficult to assign responsibility for any par-
ticular variance.
Trade-Offs among Variances Does the incident described above mean that
the decision to buy and use the off-standard material was a poor one? Not necessarily.
Perhaps these variances were anticipated, and a conscious decision was made to buy the

material anyway. How could this be a wise decision? Suppose the amounts of the vari-
ances were as follows:
$(8,500) Favorable direct-material price variance
1,000 Unfavorable direct-material quantity variance
2,000 Unfavorable direct-labor rate variance
1,500 Unfavorable direct-labor efficiency variance
$(4,000) Favorable net overall variance
The company saved money overall on the decision to use a different grade of brass
alloy. Given that the quality of the final product was not affected, the company’s manage-
ment acted wisely.
Standard Costs and Product Costing

both financial and managerial accounting.
As production takes place, product costs are added to the Work-in-Process Inventory
account. The flow of product costs through a firm’s manufacturing accounts is depicted
in Exhibit 10–6 .
Different types of product-costing systems are distinguished by the type of costs that
are entered into Work-in-Process Inventory. In Chapter 3, we studied a ctual - and n ormal -
costing systems. In these product-costing systems, the a ctual costs of direct material and
direct labor are charged to Work-in-Process Inventory. In a standard-costing system ,
the s tandard costs of direct material and direct labor are entered into Work-in-Process
Inventory.
Further explanation of the use of standard costs for product-costing purposes is pro-
vided in the appendix at the end of this chapter, which can be studied now if desired.

also too aggregate in the sense
that they are not tied to specific
product lines or production
batches. The aggregate nature of the variances makes it difficult for managers
to determine their cause.
3. Traditional standard-costing systems focus too much on the cost and efficiency
of direct labor, which is rapidly becoming a relatively unimportant factor of
production.
4. One of the most important conditions for the successful use of standard costing
is a stable production process. Yet the introduction of flexible manufacturing
systems has reduced this stability, with frequent switching among a variety of
products on the same production line.
5. Shorter product life cycles mean that standards are relevant for only a short
time. When new products are introduced, new standards must be developed.
6. Traditional standard costs are not defined broadly enough to capture various
important aspects of performance. For example, the standard direct-material
price does not capture all of the c osts of ownership. In addition to the purchase
price and transportation costs, the c ost of ownership includes the costs of
ordering, paying bills, scheduling delivery, receiving, inspecting, handling and
storing, and any production-line disruptions resulting from untimely or incor-
rect delivery.4
7. Traditional standard-costing systems tend to focus too much on cost
minimization, rather than increasing product quality or customer service. For
example, buying the least expensive materials of a given quality, in order to
avoid a material price variance, may result in using a vendor whose delivery
capabilities are not consistent with JIT requirements.
3 Cost management systems and activity-based management are covered in Chapter 5. Elimination of
non-value-added costs also is covered in Chapter 5.

Division, Texas Instruments, and Black & Decker. See L. Carr and C. Ittner, “Measuring the Cost of Ownership,”

TCO issues included are quality, delivery, flexibility, and customer service. Also consid-
ered is a supplier’s billing reliability. “As one Spennymore manager noted, ‘You can be
dealing with the best company in the world in terms of quality, but if they can’t get their
invoices right, you’re going to have trouble doing business with them.”
*“ The total cost of ownership includes all costs incurred in order to have materials in place and ready for
use in production, including the purchase price; transportation cost; and costs of ordering, receiving,
inspecting, and storing the materials.”5

of those used in practice. In using these measures to control operations, management
emphasizes trends over time. The goal is to continually improve all aspects of the

Raw Material and Scrap Raw material continues to be a significant cost element
in any manufacturing process, whether labor-intensive or highly automated. Worldwide
material sourcing and international competition have resulted in the purchasing function
taking on greater importance in many firms. As a result, purchasing performance has
become an important area of measurement; criteria include total raw-material cost, devia-
tions between actual and budgeted material prices, the quality of raw materials, and the
delivery performance of vendors.

at every stage of production. Thus, inventory control is of paramount importance in
achieving the benefits of the JIT philosophy. Inventory control measures include the
average value of inventory, the average amount of time various inventory items are
held, and other inventory turnover measures, such as the ratio of inventory value to
sales revenue.
Machinery If inventories are to be kept low, as the JIT philosophy demands, then the
production process must be capable of producing goods quickly. This goal requires that
production machinery must work when it is needed, which means that routine maintenance
schedules must be adhered to scrupulously. Performance controls in this area include
measures of machine downtime and machine availability, and detailed maintenance
records. Some manufacturers make a distinction between bottleneck machinery and

426 Chapter 10 Standard Costing, Operational Performance Measures, and the Balanced Scorecard
nonbottleneck machinery. A bottleneck operation is one that limits the production capac-
ity of the entire facility. It is vital that the machinery in bottleneck operations be available
100 percent of the time, excluding time for routine required maintenance. This emphasis
on bottleneck operations is consistent with the management philosophy known as the
theory of constraints (TOC) , which seeks to maximize long-run profit through proper
management of organizational bottlenecks or constrained resources. The key idea in
TOC is to identify the constraints in a system that are preventing the organization from
achieving a higher level of success and then to seek to relieve or relax those constraints.
Moreover, TOC recommends subordinating all other management goals to the objective
of solving the constraint problems.7
Product Quality A JIT inventory management system demands adherence to strict
quality standards for raw materials, manufactured components, and finished products.
Various nonfinancial data are vital for assessing a manufacturer’s effectiveness in main-
taining product quality. Customer-acceptance measures focus on the extent to which
a firm’s customers perceive its product to be of high quality. Typical performance mea-
sures include the number of customer complaints, the number of warranty claims, the
number of products returned, and the cost of repairing returned products. In-process
quality controls refer to procedures designed to assess product quality before production
is completed. For example, in a quality audit program, partially completed products are
randomly inspected at various stages of production. Defect rates are measured, and cor-
rective actions are suggested.
Production and Delivery A company will achieve little success if it manufactures

(joint venture of IBM and Delivering goods on time requires that they be produced on time. Various operational
Cirrus Logic) performance measures have been developed to assess the timeliness of the production
process. M anufacturing cycle time is the total amount of production time (or through-
put time) required per unit. It can be computed by dividing the total time required to
produce a batch by the number of units in the batch. V elocity is defined as the number of
units produced in a given time period. Perhaps an even more important operational mea-
sure is the manufacturing cycle efficiency (MCE) , defined as follows:
Processing time
Manufacturing cycle efficiency ! _ _________ _ ________ __ _______
Processing time # Inspection time
# Waiting time # Move time
The value of the MCE measure lies in its comparison between value-added time (pro-
cessing) and non-value-added time (inspection, waiting, and moving). In many manu-
facturing companies, MCE is less than 10 percent. Firms with advanced manufacturing
systems strive for as high an MCE measure as possible.
Productivity Global competitiveness has forced virtually all manufacturers to strive
for greater productivity. One financial productivity measure is a ggregate (or total)
productivity , defined as total output divided by total input. A firm’s total output is mea-
sured as the sum, across all of the goods and services produced, of those products and
services times their sales prices. Total input is the sum of the direct-material, direct-labor,

Chapter 10 Standard Costing, Operational Performance Measures, and the Balanced Scorecard 427
and overhead costs incurred in production. Another financial measure is a partial ( or
component) productivity measure, in which total output (in dollars) is divided by the
cost of a particular input.
A preferable approach to productivity measurement is to record multiple physical
measures that capture the most important determinants of a company’s productivity.
These o perational (or p hysical ) measures are also partial productivity measures, since
each one focuses on a particular input. For example, a large automobile manufacturer
routinely records the following data for one of its plants: the number of engines produced
per day per employee and the number of square feet of floor space required per engine
produced in a day. Data such as these convey more information to management than a
summary financial measure such as aggregate productivity.
Innovation and Learning Global competition requires that companies continu-
ally improve and innovate. New products must be developed and introduced to replace
those that have become obsolete. New processes must continually be developed to make
production more efficient. In a world-class manufacturer or service firm, the one thing
that is most constant is change.
To summarize, nonfinancial measures are being used increasingly to augment
standard-costing systems. These operational performance measures assist management
in its goal of continuous process improvement. To be most effective, operational controls
should be tied to the strategic objectives of the organization. Specific improvement tar-
gets can be set for various measures to provide motivation for improvement in the areas
deemed most important by management.
One widely used method to improve operational efficiency is b enchmarking . This
is the continual search for the most effective method of accomplishing a task by compar-
ing existing methods and performance levels with those of other organizations, or with
other subunits within the same organization. For example, hospitals routinely benchmark
their costs of patient care by diagnostic-related groups (such as circulatory disorders) by
comparing them with the costs of other hospitals.
Gain-Sharing Plans
One widely used method of providing incentives to employees to improve their perfor-
mance on various operational control measures is gain sharing. A g ain-sharing plan is
an incentive system that specifies a formula by which cost or productivity gains achieved
by a company are shared with the workers who helped accomplish the improvements.
For example, suppose an electronics manufacturer reduced its defect rate in the Man-
ual Insertion Department by 2 percent for a savings of $100,000. A gain-sharing for-
mula might call for 25 percent of the savings to be shared with the employees in that
department.
The Balanced Scorecard
Managers of the most successful organizations do not rely on either financial or nonfinan-
Learning Objective 10
cial performance measures alone. They recognize that financial performance measures
summarize the results of past actions. These measures are important to a firm’s owners, Describe the balanced

be the drivers of f uture financial performance. Thus, effective management requires a bal-
anced perspective on performance measurement, a viewpoint that some call the b alanced
scorecard perspective.
To illustrate the balanced scorecard, we will explore its use by Forest Home National
Bank (FHNB), located in Boise, Idaho. The bank’s balanced scorecard, which is depicted

operations, customer, and learning and growth. 8 What is the rationale behind FHNB’s
balanced scorecard? The bank’s overarching, long-term goal is financial growth. This
goal will be assessed by the following financial measures: profit growth percentage, rev-
enue growth percentage, and return on assets.
This begs the question, though, as to what FHNB must be doing right now to ensure
that its long-term financial goals will be met. The bank’s management has decided on
several key goals that must be achieved in the near term in order for the company’s long-
term financial goals to be met.
8 Many banking institutions have developed a balanced scorecard. This balanced scorecard is an amalgamation
of bank scorecards from a number of sources, including the author’s research as well as the following resources:
Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton, T he Strategy-Focused Organization: How Balanced Scorecard Companies
Thrive in the New Business Environment (Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 2001); Robert S. Kaplan, “Wells
Fargo Online Financial Services,” an HBS management case (Boston: President and Fellows of Harvard College,
1998); and Norman Klein and Robert S. Kaplan, “Chemical Bank: Implementing the Balanced Scorecard,” an HBS
management case (Boston: President and Fellows of Harvard College, 1995).

Chapter 10 Standard Costing, Operational Performance Measures, and the Balanced Scorecard 429
Let’s first look at the customer perspective in the balanced scorecard. The question
for FHNB’s management is “How do the bank’s customers see us?” Management has “When you buy into [the

among all the bank’s customers. Moreover, a more detailed customer satisfaction sur- commitment into it. At the end
vey is aimed at the bank’s key customers, which account for about 20 percent of the of the day, the rewards and
customer base. (2) FHNB’s management keeps track of the percentage of its customers benefits you can reap from
that it retains from one year to the next. The assumption is that a customer who stays this are tremendous.” (10f)
with FHNB is largely satisfied with the service. (3) Not all of FHNB’s customers are FMC Corporation
profitable. (This is true of almost all banks.) For example, customers that keep low
account balances, pay off their credit cards each month, and avoid service charges tend
to be unprofitable. Therefore, the percentage of profitable customers is a very impor-
tant measure. A trend in the wrong direction here would almost certainly spell trouble
for the company’s financial goals in the future. (4) FHNB’s management has found
that a particularly sensitive customer-satisfaction measure is the number of complaints
received in a month. If something is going awry in FHNB’s customer interface, cus-
tomers are not shy about letting the bank know about it—and quickly. (5) Finally,
FHNB’s market share in its coverage area is a key measure of market penetration.
Increasing this key measure would most likely translate into revenue and profit growth
in the future.
What about Forest Home National Bank’s internal operations? In what business
processes must FHNB excel in order to achieve its long-term financial goals? Manage-
ment has decided to focus on two important goals: completing routine bank transactions
efficiently and processing loan applications efficiently. For routine bank transactions
(e.g., making deposits, withdrawals, or loan payments), FHNB’s management focuses
on three key measures: (1) Customers can complete automated transactions in three
ways. They can bank online, use an ATM, or use a touch-tone telephone to make phone-
automated inquiries. FHNB’s management believes that the greater the percentage of
automated transactions, as opposed to transactions involving a bank teller, the more
efficient will be the bank’s transaction operations. (2) Another measure of transaction
efficiency is the average time that it takes a customer to complete an online transac-
tion. The smaller this time interval is, FHNB’s management believes, the more likely
customers will be to use online banking. (3) As far as manual, teller-assisted transac-
tions go, FHNB’s management keeps track of the percentage of these transactions that
exhibit errors.
On the loan side of FHNB’s internal operations, management tracks two measures
of loan processing efficiency: (1) The average time to process a loan application is a key
indicator of how smoothly this aspect of the bank’s operations is running. (2) FHNB’s
management also believes that the higher the ratio of approved to rejected loans, the more
successful the bank has been in communicating its loan criteria to the bank’s customer
base.
Finally, let’s look at the learning and growth perspective in Forest Home National
Bank’s balanced scorecard. Management has highlighted two goals: motivated and
prepared employees and innovative banking services. To assess the goal of moti-
vated and prepared employees, FHNB’s management has established three measures:
(1) The bank’s human resource management team believes that the percentage of
employees participating in voluntary continuing-education programs is an indicator
of both employee motivation and preparation. (2) On the other hand, the number of
employees in required training programs speaks to both the company’s training pro-
gram offerings as well as employee preparation. (3) The number of employee sugges-
tions per month, as well as the number of those suggestions adopted, also speaks to
both employee motivation and preparation. A motivated employee is more likely to
submit a suggestion, and a well-prepared employee is more likely to make an adopt-
able suggestion.

PAGE 465
================================================================================

430 Chapter 10 Standard Costing, Operational Performance Measures, and the Balanced Scorecard
The second goal under innovation and learning on FHNB’s scorecard involves inno-
vative banking services. (1) The number of new banking services first offered by FHNB
in its coverage area, as opposed to those first offered by competing banks, is a mea-
sure of just how innovative FHNB’s management is. (2) When the bank is able to act
positively on a customer suggestion, this too speaks to FHNB’s ability to learn from its
customer base.
All in all, FHNB’s management team believes that if the bank meets its current goals
for its customer, internal operations, and learning and growth perspectives, the bank will
ultimately be successful in achieving its long-term goal of financial growth.
Lead and Lag Measures: The Key to
the Balanced Scorecard
Key to understanding the balanced scorecard is the distinction between lead and lag
indicators of performance. Lead indicators of performance are measures of nonfinan-
cial and financial outcomes that guide management in making current decisions that
will result in desirable results in the future. In other words, lead indicators guide man-
agement to take actions n ow that will have positive effects on enterprise performance
later. For example, Forest Home National Bank’s scorecard includes the bank’s market
share in its coverage area as an indicator of future market growth, which will ultimately
translate into growth of the bank’s profitability. By including this key lead indicator in
its scorecard, management is directed to take actions now that will increase the bank’s
market share.
Lag indicators are measures of the final outcomes of earlier management decisions.
Examples of lag indicators are a company’s profit and cash flow. These key financial
measures, while important, only improve in later time periods, well after management
has taken important actions to affect key operational results. 9
The whole idea of the balanced scorecard is to use lead indicators to communicate
with, motivate, and evaluate individuals with the expectation that their current actions
will result in improvements in the company’s important lag measures (e.g., profitabil-
ity) in the future. Exhibit 10–9 gives examples of several key lead and lag measures
used in a variety of organizations’ balanced scorecards. In addition, note that most of the
Rockwater, which is now owned by H alliburton, is a
global undersea oil services company headquartered in
Aberdeen, Scotland. Doing the undersea engineering
and construction for drilling rigs such as the one pic-
tured here requires diverse technical operations, both
on- and offshore. Rockwater’s management found the
balanced scorecard to be an invaluable tool in
clarifying the company’s goals and communicating
them to the employees. Among the measures in Rock-
water’s balanced scorecard are the following: cash flow
and project profitability (financial); safety index and
hours spent with customers on new work (internal);
project pricing and customer satisfaction (customer);
percentage of revenue from new services and number
of employee suggestions (innovation and learning). 9

Linking the Balanced Scorecard
to Organizational Strategy
A key to making successful use of the balanced scorecard is linking the scorecard’s
lead and lag measures to the organization’s strategy. As depicted in the diagram in
Exhibit 10–10 , the organization’s vision and strategy drive the specification of both goals
and metrics in the scorecard’s financial, customer, internal operations, and learning and
growth perspectives.1 0

Chapter Summary
LO1 Explain how standard costing is used to help manage costs. The managerial accountant works
with others in the organization to set standard costs for direct material, direct labor, and manufacturing
overhead through either historical cost analysis or task analysis. The accountant then uses the standard
cost as a benchmark against which to compare actual costs incurred. Managers use management by
exception to determine the causes of significant cost variances.
LO2 Describe two ways to set standards and distinguish between perfection and practical
standards. One way to set standards is to analyze historical data, which will show how much it has
cost in the past to produce a product. Another way to set standards is to perform task analysis, in

which the manufacturing process is analyzed to determine what it should cost to produce the product.
A perfection (or ideal) standard is one that can be attained only under nearly perfect operating conditions.
A practical (or attainable) standard can be achieved with a production process that is as efficient as prac-
tical under normal operating conditions.
LO3 Compute and interpret the direct-material price and quantity variances and the direct-labor
rate and efficiency variances. The direct-material price variance calculates the effect on production
cost of deviations between actual and standard direct-material prices. The direct-material quantity vari-
ance calculates the effect on production cost of deviations between actual and standard direct-material
quantities allowed, given actual production output. The direct-labor rate variance calculates the effect on
production cost of deviations between actual and standard direct-labor rates. The direct-labor efficiency
variance calculates the effect on production cost of deviations between actual and standard direct-labor
hours allowed, given actual production output.
LO4 Explain several methods for determining the significance of cost variances. Managers
determine the significance of cost variances through judgment and rules of thumb. The absolute and
relative sizes of variances, recurrence of variances, variance trends, and controllability of variances are
all considered in deciding whether variances warrant investigation. In some cases a statistical control
chart can help determine the significance of cost variances.
LO5 Describe some behavioral effects of standard costing. When variances can affect employees’
reward structures, such as pay increases or promotions, they can significantly affect employee behavior.
For example, an unfavorable direct-material price variance may cause a purchasing manager to purchase
a lower quality of material than what is specified or needed.
LO6 Explain how standard costs are used in product costing. The managerial accountant
achieves the product-costing purpose of the standard-costing system by entering the standard cost of
production into Work-in-Process Inventory as a product cost. This standard cost then flows through the
Finished-Goods Inventory account and into the Cost of Goods Sold account.
LO7 Summarize some advantages of standard costing. Standard-costing systems offer an organiza-
tion many advantages. Among these are: sensible cost comparisons; management by exception; perfor-
mance evaluation; employee motivation; and more stable product costs.
LO8 Explain several common criticisms of standard costing. Some common criticisms of standard
costing include: too high a level of aggregation exhibited by variances; untimely reporting of variances;
excessive focus on direct labor; inconsistency with flexible manufacturing systems; quick outdating of
standards; narrow focus of standard costs, such as ignoring the total cost of ownership; and an excessive
focus on cost minimization.
LO9 Describe the operational performance measures appropriate for today’s manufacturing
environment. Nonfinancial measures of operational performance are widely used to augment the con-
trol information provided by standard costing. These measures typically focus on raw material and
scrap, inventory, machinery, product quality, production and delivery, productivity, and innovation and
learning.
LO10 Describe the balanced scorecard concept and explain the reasoning behind it. The balanced
scorecard is an important tool designed to focus management’s attention on key current goals, which, if
achieved, will facilitate the attainment of the organization’s long-term goals. By achieving current goals
in the customer, internal operations, and learning and growth perspectives, the company will ultimately
achieve its long-term financial goals.
LO11 Prepare journal entries to record and close out cost variances (appendix). The managerial
accountant prepares journal entries: to enter the standard cost of production into Work-in-Process Inven-
tory as a product cost; to transfer the standard production cost to Finished-Goods Inventory; and to close
the standard production cost into Cost of Goods Sold.

APPENDIX TO CHAPTER 10
Use of Standard Costs for
Product Costing
In addition to providing a tool for c ost management, standard-costing systems also provide the necessary
Learning Objective 11 information to be used in product costing. As shown in Exhibit 10–6 , under standard costing, it is the
standard costs that are entered into Work-in-Process Inventory as a product cost.
Prepare journal entries to
record and close out cost vari-
ances (Appendix). J ournal Entries under Standard Costing To illustrate the use of standard costs in product costing,
we will continue our illustration of D Cdesserts.com. For September’s production of multilayer fancy
cakes, the company purchased 12,500 pounds of direct material for $17,750. The actual quantity of
material used in production was 10,250 pounds. However, the standard cost of direct material, given
September’s actual output of 2,000 multilayer fancy cakes, was only $14,000. The following journal
entries record these facts and isolate the direct-material price and quantity variances.
Raw-Material Inventory .............................................................................................. 17,500
Direct-Material Price Variance .................................................................................... 250
Accounts Payable ............................................................................................. 17,750
To record the purchase of raw material and the incurrence of an
unfavorable price variance.
Work-in-Process Inventory ......................................................................................... 14,000
Direct-Material Quantity Variance ............................................................................... 350
Raw-Material Inventory ..................................................................................... 14,350
To record the use of direct material in production and the incurrence of an
unfavorable quantity variance.
N otice that the material purchase is recorded in the Raw-Material Inventory account at its stan-
dard price ($17,500 ! 12,500 pounds purchased " $1.40 per pound). The $14,000 debit entry to
Work-in-Process Inventory adds only the standard cost of the material to Work-in-Process Inventory as
a product cost ($14,000 ! 10,000 pounds allowed " $1.40 per pound). The two variances are isolated
in their own variance accounts. Since they are both unfavorable, they are represented by debit entries.
T he following journal entry records the actual September cost of direct labor, as an addition to
Wages Payable. The entry also adds the standard cost of direct labor to Work-in-Process Inventory and
isolates the direct-labor variances.
Work-in-Process Inventory ......................................................................................... 20,000
Direct-Labor Rate Variance ........................................................................................ 980
Direct-Labor Efficiency Variance ........................................................................ 400
Wages Payable ................................................................................................ 20,580
To record the usage of direct labor and the direct-labor variances
for September.
Since the direct-labor efficiency variance is favorable, it is recorded as a credit entry.
Disposition of Variances Variances are temporary accounts, like revenue and expense accounts,
and they are closed out at the end of each accounting period. Most companies close their variance
accounts directly into Cost of Goods Sold. The journal entry required to close out the September vari-
ances incurred in the production of multilayer fancy cakes is as follows:
hiL10912_ch10_404_457.indd 438 8/3/10 4:02 PM
================================================================================
PAGE 474
================================================================================

Chapter 10 Standard Costing, Operational Performance Measures, and the Balanced Scorecard 439
Cost of Goods Sold .................................................................................................... 1,180
Direct-Labor Efficiency Variance ................................................................................. 400
Direct-Labor Rate Variance ................................................................................ 980
Direct-Material Price Variance ........................................................................... 250
Direct-Material Quantity Variance ....................................................................... 350
The increase of $1,180 in Cost of Goods Sold is explained as follows:
Unfavorable Variances Favorable Variance Net Increase
Increase Cost of Decreases Cost in Cost of
Goods Sold of Goods Sold Goods Sold
Direct-labor efficiency variance ........... $400
Direct-labor rate variance ................... $ 980
Direct-material price variance ............. 250
Direct-material quantity variance ......... 350
Total .............................................. $1,580 $ $400 ! $1,180
The unfavorable variances represent costs of operating inefficiently, relative to the standards, and thus
cause Cost of Goods Sold to be higher. The opposite is true for favorable variances.
An alternative method of variance disposition is to apportion all variances among Work-in-Process
Inventory, Finished-Goods Inventory, and Cost of Goods Sold. This accounting treatment reflects the
effects of unusual inefficiency or efficiency in all of the accounts through which the manufacturing costs
flow. This method, called variance proration, is covered more fully in cost accounting texts.
Cost Flow Under Standard Costing In a standard-costing system, since standard costs are entered
into Work-in-Process Inventory, standard costs flow through all of the manufacturing accounts. Thus,
as depicted in Exhibit 10–6 , all of the product costs flowing through the accounts are standard costs. To
illustrate, suppose DCdesserts.com produced 2,000 multilayer fancy cakes in September and sold all
2,000 of them. The journal entries to record the flow of standard direct-material and direct-labor costs
are shown below.
Finished-Goods Inventory .......................................................................................... 34,000*
Work-in-Process Inventory ..................................................................................... 34,000
*Total standard cost of direct material and direct labor: $34,000 ! $14,000 # $20,000.
Cost of Goods Sold .................................................................................................... 34,000*
Finished-Goods Inventory ...................................................................................... 34,000
* All 2,000 multilayer fancy cakes were sold.
Our illustration is not really complete yet, because we have not discussed manufacturing-overhead costs.
This topic is covered in the next chapter. The important point at this juncture is that in a standard-costing sys-
tem, standard costs rather than actual costs flow through the manufacturing accounts.
A Note on Perishable Products and JIT Production Management Systems Traditional manufac-
turing systems typically exhibit the cost flows explained in this section. Direct-material, direct-labor,
and manufacturing-overhead costs are entered in Work-in-Process Inventory, from which they flow into
Finished-Goods Inventory when the goods are finished, and then on into Cost of Goods Sold. Since
DCdesserts.com produces perishable goods, which are produced and sold on the same day, a simpler
procedure could be used. In DCdesserts.com ’s case, the standard costs of direct material, direct labor,
and manufacturing overhead could be entered directly into Cost of Goods Sold as they are incurred. This
simplified procedure could be used, because the production process is very short and the goods are sold
immediately. Thus, there is never any work-in-process inventory or finished-goods inventory on hand.
Such situations are common with producers of perishable goods.

================================================================================

440 Chapter 10 Standard Costing, Operational Performance Measures, and the Balanced Scorecard
An analogous situation occurs in manufacturers that employ a just-in-time (JIT) production and
inventory control system. In a JIT environment, raw materials are delivered just in time to be entered
into production, and parts or components are manufactured in each stage of the production process
just in time for the next production stage. Thus, like the case of perishable goods, there is little or no
work-in-process or finished-goods inventory at any given time in a JIT environment. For this reason,
many manufacturers that employ the JIT approach make use of highly simplified cost accounting proce-
dures similar to those explained in the preceding paragraph for DCdesserts.com .

to provide a quality product at a fair price, with delivery on the promised date. Boston is finding it Responsibility for Variances
increasingly difficult to personally supervise the operations of AMG, and he is beginning to institute an (LO 2)
organizational structure that would facilitate management control.
One change recently made was the transfer of control over departmental operations from Boston to
each departmental manager. However, the Quality Control Department still reports directly to Boston,
as do the Finance and Accounting Departments. A materials manager was hired to purchase all raw
materials and to oversee the material-handling (receiving, storage, etc.) and recordkeeping functions.
The materials manager also is responsible for maintaining an adequate inventory based on planned
production levels.
The loss of personal control over the operations of AMG caused Boston to look for a method of
efficiently evaluating performance. Dave Cress, a new managerial accountant, proposed the use of a
standard-costing system. Variances for material and labor could then be calculated and reported directly
to Boston.
Required:
1. Assume that Associated Media Graphics is going to implement a standard-costing system and
establish standards for materials and labor. Identify and discuss for each of these cost components:
a. Who should be involved in setting the standards?
b. What factors should be considered in establishing the standards?
2. Describe the basis for assignment of responsibility for variances under a standard-costing system.

2. Explain the role of each of the following people in developing standards.
a. Purchasing manager.
b. Industrial engineer.
c. Managerial accountant.
3. The production manager complained that the standards are unrealistic, stifle motivation by con-

tion has become increasingly important. Doug Gilbert, the company’s controller, is planning to
1. Total standard cost per implement a standard cost system for Quincy and has gathered considerable information from his
10-gallon batch: $30.20 co-workers on production and material requirements for Quincy’s products. Gilbert believes that
the use of standard costing will allow Quincy to improve cost control and make better pricing
decisions.
Quincy’s most popular product is strawberry jam. The jam is produced in 10-gallon batches, and
each batch requires six quarts of good strawberries. The fresh strawberries are sorted by hand before
entering the production process. Because of imperfections in the strawberries and normal spoilage, one
quart of berries is discarded for every four quarts of acceptable berries. Three minutes is the standard
direct-labor time for sorting required to obtain one quart of acceptable strawberries. The acceptable
strawberries are then blended with the other ingredients. Blending requires 12 minutes of direct-labor
time per batch. After blending, the jam is packaged in quart containers. Gilbert has gathered the follow-
ing information from Joe Adams, Quincy’s cost accountant.
• Quincy purchases strawberries at a cost of $.80 per quart. All other ingredients cost a total of $.45
per gallon.
• Direct labor is paid at the rate of $9.00 per hour.
• The total cost of material and labor required to package the jam is $.38 per quart.
Adams has a friend who owns a strawberry farm that has been losing money in recent years.
Because of good crops, there has been an oversupply of strawberries, and prices have dropped to $.50
per quart. Adams has arranged for Quincy to purchase strawberries from his friend and hopes that $.80
per quart will help his friend’s farm become profitable again.
Required:
1. Develop the standard cost for the direct-cost components of a 10-gallon batch of strawberry jam.
The standard cost should identify the following amounts for each direct-cost component of a
batch of strawberry jam: ( a ) standard quantity. ( b ) standard price or rate, and (c ) standard cost
per batch.

helping MedLine remain competitive. Harrington decided to implement a gain-sharing plan that would
(LO 9)
encourage employees to focus on operational areas that were important to customers and that added
value without increasing cost. In addition to a profitability incentive, the revised plan also includes 1. Charter Division, total
incentives for reduced rework costs, reduced sales returns, and on-time deliveries. Bonuses are calcu- bonus awarded for the year:
lated and awarded semiannually on the following basis. The bonuses are distributed among the relevant $6,600
employees according to a formula developed by the division manager.
• Profitability: Two percent of operating income.
• Rework: Costs in excess of 2 percent of operating income are deducted from the bonus amount.
• On-time delivery: $5,000 if over 98 percent of deliveries are on time, $2,000 if 96 to 98 percent of
deliveries are on time, and no increment if on-time deliveries are below 96 percent.
• Sales returns: $3,000 if returns are less than 1.5 percent of sales. Fifty percent of any amount in
excess of 1.5 percent of sales is deducted from the bonus amount.
• N ote: If the calculation of the bonus results in a negative amount for a particular period, there is no
bonus, and the negative amount is not carried forward to the next period.
The revised bonus plan was implemented on January 1, 20x1. Presented in the following table are
the results for two of Medline’s divisions, Charter and Mesa Divisions, for the first year under the new
bonus plan. Both of these divisions had similar sales and operating income results for the prior year,
when the old bonus plan was in effect. Based on the 20x0 results, the employees of the Charter Division
earned a bonus of $27,060 while the employees of the Mesa Division earned $22,440.

THIS CHAPTER’S FOCUS COMPANY is DCdesserts.com, and contin-

fancy desserts to a variety of restaurants, caterers, and upscale food stores in Washington,
D.C. In this chapter, we explore DCdesserts.com’s
use of flexible budgeting to plan for and control
overhead costs. A flexible budget allows for a variety of levels
of activity. As activity increases, the costs in the flexible
budget rise as well. This tool enables management to
compare the actual overhead costs incurred with the
costs that should have been incurred, given
the actual level of production activity.

In contrast to the food-processing setting of DCdesserts.com, we turn
our attention to flexible budgeting in the service industry. Upstate Auto
Rentals is a small automobile rental company in upstate New York. The company has four
rental locations in and around Syracuse and specializes in short-term car rentals, primar-
ily for local use when a customer’s car is in the repair shop. Upstate’s flexible budget uses
two cost drivers: the number of miles driven by its rental cars and the number of customer
contracts.

AFTER COMPLETING THIS CHAPTER, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
1 Distinguish between static and flexible budgets and explain the advantages of a
flexible overhead budget.
2 Prepare a flexible overhead budget, using both a formula and a columnar format.
3 Explain how overhead is applied to Work-in-Process Inventory under standard
costing.
4 Explain some important issues in choosing an activity measure for overhead bud-
geting and application.
5 Compute and interpret the variable-overhead spending and efficiency variances
and the fixed-overhead budget and volume variances.
6 Prepare an overhead cost performance report.
7 Explain how an activity-based flexible budget differs from a conventional flexible
budget.
8 Prepare journal entries to record manufacturing overhead under standard costing
(Appendix A).
9 Compute and interpret the sales-price and sales-volume variances (Appendix B).
How do service industry companies, such as A etna, Baskin-Robbins, B udget Rent-a-Car,
C hase Bank, D ays Inn, and U nited Airlines control the overhead costs they incur in pro-
ducing their services? Similarly, how do manufacturing firms such as General Motors,
H ewlett-Packard, and W hirlpool control the many overhead costs incurred in their pro-
duction processes? Unlike direct material and direct labor, overhead costs are not trace-
able to individual products. Moreover, overhead is a pool of many different kinds of
costs. Indirect material, indirect labor, and other indirect production costs often exhibit
different relationships to productive activity. Some overhead costs are variable, and some
are fixed. Moreover, different individuals in an organization are responsible for different
types of overhead costs.
Considering all of these issues together, controlling overhead presents a challenge
for managerial accountants. In this chapter, we will study an accounting system that is
widely used to control overhead costs.
Overhead Budgets
Since direct material and direct labor are traceable to products, it is straightforward to

determine standard costs for these inputs. If a table requires 20 board feet of oak lum-

Chapter 11 Flexible Budgeting and the Management of Overhead and Support Activity Costs 461
Flexible Budgets
The tool used by most companies to control overhead costs is called a f lexible budget. A
flexible budget resembles the budgets we studied in Chapter 9, with one important differ-
ence: A flexible budget is not based on only one level of activity. Instead, a flexible budget
covers a range of activity within which the firm may operate. A flexible overhead budget
is defined as a detailed plan for controlling overhead costs that is valid in the firm’s rel-
evant range of activity. In contrast, a s tatic budget is based on a particular planned level
of activity.
At DCdesserts.com , the measure of activity used for flexible budgeting purposes is
process time. The process time for a dessert is the total amount of time the product is in
process, including selecting ingredients, mixing, baking, cooling, assembly and finish-
ing, and packaging. DCdesserts.com’s director of cost management estimates that the
average process time required for fancy desserts is three hours.
To illustrate the flexible budgeting concept, suppose DCdesserts.com’s director of
cost management has determined that electricity is a variable cost, incurred at the rate
of $.50 per hour of process time. Two different budgets for electricity cost are shown in
Exhibit 11–1 . The static budget is based on management’s predicted level of activity for
September—7,500 hours of process time. This estimate is based on planned production
of 2,500 multilayer fancy cakes, where each cake requires three hours of total process
time. The flexible budget includes three different production activity levels within the
relevant range: 6,000, 7,500, and 9,000 hours of process time.
Advantages of Flexible Budgets
Why is the distinction between static and flexible budgets so important? Suppose
DCdesserts.com produced 2,000 multilayer fancy cakes during September, used 6,000
hours of process time, and incurred electricity costs of $3,200. Does this constitute good
control or poor control of electricity costs? Which budget in E xhibit 11–1 is more useful
in answering this question?
A manager using the static budget makes the following comparison.
Budgeted Electricity Cost
Actual Electricity Cost (static budget) Cost Variance
$3,200 .......................................................... $3,750 .............................. $550 Favorable
This comparison suggests that operating personnel maintained excellent control over
electricity costs during September, generating a favorable variance of $550. Is this a valid
analysis and conclusion?
The fault with this analysis is that the manager is comparing the electricity cost
incurred at the a ctual activity level, 2,000 multilayer fancy cakes, with the budgeted elec-
tricity cost at the p lanned activity level, 2,500 multilayer fancy cakes. Since these activity
levels are different, we should expect the electricity cost to be different.

462 Chapter 11 Flexible Budgeting and the Management of Overhead and Support Activity Costs
A more sensible approach is to compare the actual electricity cost incurred with the
cost that should be incurred when 2,000 multilayer fancy cakes are produced. At this
production level, 6,000 process hours should be used (3 per cake). The flexible budget in
Exhibit 11–1 shows that the manager should expect $3,000 of electricity cost at the 6,000
process-hour level of activity. Therefore, an analysis based on the flexible budget gives
the following comparison.
Budgeted Electricity Cost
Actual Electricity Cost (flexible budget) Cost Variance
$3,200 ......................................................... $3,000 ............................. $200 Unfavorable
Now the manager’s conclusion is different; the revised analysis indicates an unfavor-
able variance. Electricity cost was greater than it should have been, given the actual level
of output. The flexible budget provides the correct basis for comparison between actual
and expected costs, given actual activity.
The Activity Measure
Notice that the flexible budget for electricity cost in Exhibit 11–1 is based on hours
of process time, which is an input in the production process. The process-hour activ-
ity levels shown in the flexible budget are the standard allowed process hours given
various levels of output. If 2,000 multilayer fancy cakes are produced, and the standard
allowance per cake is 3 process hours, then the standard allowed number of process
hours is 6,000.
Why are the activity levels in the flexible budget based on process hours, an i nput
measure, instead of the number of multilayer fancy cakes produced, an output measure?
When only a single product is manufactured, it makes no difference whether the flexible
budget is based on input or output. In our illustration, either of the flexible budgets shown
in Exhibit 11–2 could be used.
Now suppose that during August, DCdesserts.com produced three different products:
1,000 multilayer fancy cakes, 1,500 single-layer sheet cakes, and 600 specialty cakes
(such as wedding cakes). The following standards have been assigned to these products.

Recall that the controller estimates electricity cost at $.50 per process hour. Thus, the
flexible-budget cost of electricity during August is computed as follows:

Electricity cost per process hour ......................................................................................................................... ! $.50
Flexible budget for electricity cost ...................................................................................................................... $4,800
The important point is that units of output usually is not a meaningful measure
in a multiproduct firm, because it would require us to add numbers of unlike prod-
ucts. To avoid this problem, output is measured in terms of the s tandard allowed input,
given actual output. The flexible overhead budget is then based on this standard input
measure.
Flexible Overhead Budget Illustrated
DCdesserts.com’s monthly flexible overhead budget is shown in the Excel spreadsheet
Learning Objective 2
in Exhibit 11–3 . The overhead costs on the flexible budget are divided into variable and
fixed costs. The total budgeted variable cost increases proportionately with increases in Prepare a flexible overhead

cent, from $30,000 to $45,000. In contrast, the total budgeted fixed overhead does not
change with increases in activity; it remains constant at $15,000 per month.
Formula Flexible Budget
When overhead costs can be divided into variable and fixed categories, we can express
the flexible overhead budget differently. The format used in Exhibit 11–3 is called a
columnar flexible budget. The budgeted overhead cost for each overhead item is listed
in a column under a particular activity level. Notice that the columnar format allows for
only a limited number of activity levels. DCdesserts.com’s flexible budget shows only
three.
A more general format for expressing a flexible budget is called a formula flexible
budget. In this format, the managerial accountant expresses the relationship between
activity and total budgeted overhead cost by the following formula:
T ota l bu dg ete d B u dge te d v ari ab le- T ota l B u dg ete d f ixe d-
m o nth ly o v e rhe a d " ov erh ea d c os t p e r ! a ct ivi t y # ov er he a d cos t
cost activity unit units per month
To use this formula for DaCdesserts.com , we first need tbo compute the budgeted variable-
overhead cost per process hour. Dividing total budgeted variable-overhead cost by the
associated activity level yields a budgeted variable-overhead rate of $5 per process hour.
Notice that we can use any activity level in Exhibit 11–3 to compute this rate.

standard costing, insofar as overhead is concerned, lies in the quantity of hours used.
Both normal- and standard-costing systems use a predetermined overhead rate. In
a standard-costing system, the predetermined overhead rate also is referred to as the
standard overhead rate. DCdesserts.com calculates its predetermined or standard over-
head rate annually. The rate for the current year, computed in Exhibit 11–5 , is based on
planned activity of 7,500 process hours per month. Notice that DCdesserts.com breaks its
predetermined overhead rate into a variable rate and a fixed rate. We will discuss further
the use of standard costs for product costing in Appendix A at the end of this chapter.

for overhead budgeting and because the flexible budget is the chief tool for managing overhead costs.
application.
Criteria for Choosing the Activity Measure
How should the managerial accountant select the activity measure for the flexible bud-
get? The activity measure should be one that varies in a similar pattern to the way that
variable overhead varies. As productive activity increases, both variable-overhead cost
and the activity measure should increase in roughly the same proportion. As productive
activity declines, both variable-overhead cost and the activity measure should decline in
roughly the same proportion. In short, variable-overhead cost and the activity measure
should move together as overall productive activity changes.
Changing Manufacturing Technology: Computer-Integrated Manu-
facturing Direct-labor time has traditionally been a popular activity measure in man-
ufacturing firms. However, as automation increases, more and more firms are switching
to such measures as machine hours or process time for their flexible overhead budgets.
Machine hours and process time are linked more closely than direct-labor hours to the
robotic technology and computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) systems common in
today’s manufacturing environment.
As manufacturing has become increasingly automated, direct labor is becoming less appropriate as an activity measure
in flexible budgeting. Moreover, computer-integrated manufacturing entails a shift in the cost structure away from
direct-labor costs and toward greater overhead costs. Left, employees inspect and pack clothes at the Zipsa industrial
park near Managua, Nicaragua (a labor-intensive activity). Right, a robot assembles washing machines at the BSC Bosch
Siemens consumer appliances factory in Nauen, Germany (a high-tech process).

Chapter 11 Flexible Budgeting and the Management of Overhead and Support Activity Costs 467
Cost Drivers As we discussed in Chapter 5, some companies have refined their cost
management systems even further. C ost drivers are identified as the most significant fac-
tors affecting overhead costs. Then multiple overhead rates based on these cost drivers
are used to compute product costs and control overhead expenditures. A relentless search
for n on-value-added costs is an integral part of such a cost management system. We will
discuss the role of a ctivity-based costing in flexible budgeting later in the chapter.
Beware of Dollar Measures Dollar measures, such as direct-labor or raw-
material costs, often are used as the basis for flexible overhead budgeting. However,
such measures have significant drawbacks, and they should be avoided. Dollar measures
are subject to price-level changes and fluctuate more than physical measures. For exam-
ple, the direct-labor h ours required to produce a fancy dessert will be relatively stable
over time. However, the direct-labor c ost will vary as wage levels and fringe-benefit
costs change with inflation and conditions in the labor market.
The choice of an activity measure upon which to base the flexible budget for variable
overhead is really a cost-estimation problem, which is the topic addressed in Chapter 7.
Cost Management Using Overhead Cost Variances

Flexible Budget DCdesserts.com’s monthly flexible overhead budget, displayed
in Exhibit 11–3 , shows budgeted variable and fixed manufacturing-overhead costs at
three levels of production activity. During September, DCdesserts.com produced 2,000
multilayered fancy cakes. Since production standards allow three process hours per cake,
the total standard allowed number of process hours is 6,000 hours.
Actual production output ................................................................................................... 2,000 multilayered fancy cakes

September is as follows:

The production supervisor’s records indicate that the actual total process time in
September was as follows:
Actual process hours for September .................................................................................................................... 6,300
Notice that the actual number of process hours used (6,300) exceeds the standard allowed
number of process hours, given actual production output (6,000).
We now have assembled all of the information necessary to compute DCdesserts.com’s
overhead variances for September.

What caused the company to spend $4,650 more than the budgeted amount on
variable overhead? To discover the reasons behind this performance, the managerial
accountant computes a v ariable-overhead spending variance and a v ariable-overhead
efficiency variance. The computation of these variances is depicted in Exhibit 11–6 .
Two equivalent formulas for the variable-overhead spending variance are shown

These two formulas are equivalent because actual variable overhead is equal to actual
hours times the actual variable overhead rate (AH ! AVR). Formula 2 above can be
simplified as follows:
3. Variable-overhead spending variance " AH(AVR $ SVR)
DCdesserts.com’s variable-overhead spending variance for September is computed
as follows (using formula 1):
Var iab le- ove rhe ad
" Actual variable overhead $ (AH ! SVR),
spending variance
" $34,650 $ (6,300 ! $5.00)
" $3,150 Unfavorable
This variance is unfavorable because the actual variable-overhead cost exceeded the
expected amount, after adjusting that expectation for the actual number of process hours
used.
As Exhibit 11–6 shows, the following formula defines the variable-overhead
efficiency variance.
Variable-overhead efficiency variance " (AH ! SVR) $ (SH ! SVR)
where SH denotes standard process hours
Writing this formula more simply, we have the following expression.
Variable-overhead efficiency variance " SVR(AH $ SH)
DCdesserts.com’s variable-overhead efficiency variance for September is computed as
follows:
Variable-overhead efficiency variance " SVR(AH $ SH)
" $5.00(6,300 $ 6,000)
" $1,500 Unfavorable
This variance is unfavorable because actual process hours exceeded standard allowed
process hours, given actual output.
Product Costing versus Cost Management Columns (1), (2), and (3) in
Exhibit 11–6 are used to compute the variances for c ost management purposes. Column (4)
in the exhibit shows the variable overhead applied to work in process for the p roduct-
costing purpose. Notice that the variable-overhead cost on the flexible budget, $30,000,
is the same as the amount applied to work in process.
Graphing Variable-Overhead Variances Exhibit 11–7 provides a graphi-
cal analysis of DCdesserts.com’s variable-overhead variances for September. The graph
shows the variable-overhead rate per process hour on the vertical axis. The standard rate
is $5.00 per process hour, while the actual rate is $5.50 per process hour (actual variable-
overhead cost of $34,650 divided by actual process hours of 6,300). Process hours are
shown on the horizontal axis.
The green area on the graph represents the flexible-budget amount for variable over-
head, given actual September output of 2,000 multilayered fancy cakes. The large area on
the graph enclosed by colored lines on the top and right sides represents actual variable-
overhead cost. The colored area in between, representing the total variable-overhead vari-
ance, is divided into the spending and efficiency variances.
Managerial Interpretation of Variable-Overhead Variances What
do the variable-overhead variances mean? What information do they convey to man-
agement? The formulas for computing the variable-overhead variances resemble

those used to compute the direct-labor variances. To see this, compare Exhibit 11–6
(variable overhead) with Exhibit 10–3 (direct labor).
Despite the similar formulas, the interpretation of the variable-overhead variances is
quite different from that applicable to the direct-labor variances.
Efficiency Variance Recall that an unfavorable direct-labor efficiency variance
results when more direct labor is used than the standard allowed quantity. Thus, direct
labor has been used inefficiently, relative to the standard. However, that is not the proper
interpretation of an unfavorable variable-overhead efficiency variance. DCdesserts.com’s
variable-overhead efficiency variance did n ot result from using more of the variable-
overhead items, such as electricity and indirect material, than the standard allowed
amount. Instead, this variance resulted when the division used more process hours than
the standard quantity, given actual output. Recall that the company’s director of cost man-
agement has found that variable-overhead cost varies in a pattern similar to that with
which process hours vary. Since 300 more process hours were used than the standard
quantity, the division’s management should expect that variable-overhead costs will be
greater. Thus, the variable-overhead efficiency variance has nothing to do with efficient
or inefficient usage of electricity, indirect material, and other variable-overhead items.
This variance simply reflects an adjustment in the managerial accountant’s expectation
about variable-overhead cost, because the division used more than the standard quantity
of process hours.
What is the important difference between direct labor and variable overhead that
causes this different interpretation of the efficiency variance? Direct labor is a traceable
cost and is budgeted on the basis of direct-labor hours. Variable overhead, on the other
hand, is a pool of indirect costs that are budgeted on the basis of process hours. The
indirect nature of variable-overhead costs causes the different interpretation.
Spending Variance An unfavorable direct-labor rate variance is straightforward
to interpret; the actual labor rate per hour exceeds the standard rate. Although the for-
mula for computing the variable-overhead spending variance is similar to that for the
direct-labor rate variance, its interpretation is quite different.
An unfavorable spending variance simply means that the total actual cost of variable
overhead is greater than expected, after adjusting for the actual quantity of process hours
used. An unfavorable spending variance could result from paying a higher-than-expected

Chapter 11 Flexible Budgeting and the Management of Overhead and Support Activity Costs 471
price per unit for variable-overhead items. Or the variance could result from using more
of the variable-overhead items than expected.
Suppose, for example, that electricity were the only variable-overhead cost item.
An unfavorable variable-overhead spending variance could result from paying a higher-
than-expected price per kilowatt-hour for electricity, from using more than the expected
amount of electricity, or from both.
Management of Variable Overhead Costs Since the variable-overhead
efficiency variance says nothing about efficient or inefficient usage of variable overhead,
the spending variance is the real control variance for variable overhead. Managers can
use the spending variance to alert them if variable-overhead costs are out of line with
expectations.
Fixed Overhead
To analyze performance with regard to fixed overhead, the managerial accountant calcu-
lates two fixed-overhead variances.
Fixed-Overhead Budget Variance The variance used by managers to control
fixed overhead is called the f ixed-overhead budget variance. It is defined as follows:
F ix ed -ov er he ad
" Actual fixed overhead $ Budgeted fixed overhead
budget variance
DCdesserts.com’s fixed-overhead budget variance for September is as follows:
F ix ed -ov er he ad
" Actual fixed overhead $ Budgeted fixed overhead
budget variance
" $16,100 $ $15,000*
" $1,100 Unfavorable
* From the fl exible budget ( Exhibit 11–3 ).
The fixed-overhead budget variance is unfavorable, because the company spent more
than the budgeted amount on fixed overhead. Notice that we need not specify an activ-
ity level to determine budgeted fixed overhead. All three columns in the flexible budget
( Exhibit 11–3 ) specify $15,000 as budgeted fixed overhead.
Fixed-Overhead Volume Variance The f ixed-overhead volume variance is
defined as follows:
F ix ed -ov erh ea d
" Budgeted fixed overhead $ Applied fixed overhead
volume variance
DCdesserts.com’s applied fixed overhead for September is $12,000:
A p pli ed fix ed
"
P re det erm in ed f ix ed
! Standard allowed hours
overhead overhead rate
" $2.00 per process hour ! 6,000 process hours
" $12,000
The $2.00 predetermined fixed-overhead rate was calculated in Exhibit 11–5 . The 6,000
standard allowed process hours is based on actual September production of 2,000 multi-

Managerial Interpretation of Fixed-Overhead Variances Exhibit 11–8
shows DCdesserts.com’s two fixed-overhead variances for September. The budget vari-
ance is the real control variance for fixed overhead, because it compares actual expendi-
tures with budgeted fixed-overhead costs.
The volume variance provides a way of reconciling two different purposes of the cost
management system. For the c ontrol purpose, the system recognizes that fixed overhead
does not change as production activity varies. Hence, budgeted fixed overhead is the
same at all activity levels in the flexible budget. (Review Exhibit 11–3 to verify this.)
Budgeted fixed overhead is the basis for controlling fixed overhead, because it provides
the benchmark against which actual expenditures are compared.
For the p roduct-costing purpose of the system, budgeted fixed overhead is divided
by planned activity to obtain a predetermined (or standard) fixed-overhead rate. For
DCdesserts.com , this rate is $2.00 per process hour (budgeted fixed overhead of
$15,000 divided by planned activity of 7,500 process hours). This predetermined rate is
then used to apply fixed overhead to Work-in-Process Inventory. During any period in
which the standard allowed number of process hours, given actual output, differs from
the planned level of process hours, the budgeted fixed overhead differs from applied
fixed overhead.
Exhibit 11–9 illustrates this point graphically. Budgeted fixed overhead is constant at
$15,000 for all levels of activity. However, applied fixed overhead increases with activ-
ity, since fixed overhead is applied to Work-in-Process Inventory at the rate of $2.00
per standard allowed process hour. Notice that budgeted and applied fixed overhead are
equal o nly if the number of standard allowed hours equals the planned activity level of
7,500 process hours. When this happens, there is no fixed-overhead volume variance.
DCdesserts.com has a $3,000 volume variance in September because the standard
allowed hours and planned hours are different.
Capacity Utilization A common, but faulty, interpretation of a positive vol-
ume variance is that it measures the cost of underutilizing productive capacity. Some
firms even designate a positive volume variance as unfavorable. The reasoning behind
this view is that the planned activity level used to compute the predetermined fixed-
overhead rate is a measure of normal capacity utilization. Moreover, fixed-overhead costs,
such as depreciation and property taxes, are costs incurred to create productive capacity.
              
*Consistent with our discussion of the fixed-overhead volume variance,some managerial accountants would designate a positive variance as
“unfavorable.”

Therefore, the predetermined fixed-overhead rate measures the cost of providing an hour
of productive capacity. If 7,500 process hours are planned, but output is such that only
6,000 standard process hours are allowed, then capacity has been underutilized by 1,500
hours. Since each hour costs $2.00 ( DCdesserts.com’s predetermined fixed-overhead
rate), the cost of underutilization is $3,000 (1,500 ! $2.00), which is DCdesserts.com’s
volume variance.
The fault with this interpretation of the volume variance is that it ignores the real cost
of underutilizing productive capacity. The real cost is due to the lost contribution margins
of the products that are not produced when capacity is underutilized. Moreover, this inter-
pretation fails to recognize that underutilizing capacity and reducing inventory may be a
wise managerial response to slackening demand.
For this reason, many managerial accountants interpret the volume variance merely
as a way of reconciling the two purposes of the cost management system. Moreover,
these managerial accountants would choose not to designate the volume variance as
either favorable or unfavorable. However, some accountants designate a positive volume
variance as u nfavorable. Their reasoning is that when the volume variance is closed into
Cost of Goods Sold expense at the end of the accounting period (as explained in Appen-
dix A), the effect is to increase Cost of Goods Sold, which in turn has an unfavorable
effect on income. In contrast, other accountants argue that no sign (favorable or unfavor-
able) should be assigned to the fixed-overhead volume variance.

A ccounting COST MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IN GERMANY
P ractice Throughout the world, flexible budgeting is found in cost management systems as a
means of controlling overhead costs. In Germany, for example, grenzplankostenrech-
Stihl, Inc.
nung (or “flexible standard costing”) exhibits many of the features illustrated in this chap-
ter. Under the German approach, “each cost center distinguishes between variable costs
(e.g., energy) and fixed costs (e.g., a manager’s salary).” The number of machine hours
is a common activity measure. “For purposes of cost planning and control, companies
budget each cost center’s expenses and then distribute the expenses to each month of
the budget year. The budgeted costs are standards for efficient resource consumption.
. . .” The cost and performance information “allows for effective discussions about pro-
ductivity improvement” among department managers, management accountants, and
plant managers.
Among the companies using the flexible standard costing system is Stihl, a
well-known German manufacturer of chain saws and other landscaping equipment. 1

This approach is consistent with traditional, volume-based product-costing systems.
Under the more accurate product-costing method called activity-based costing,
several cost drivers are identified. 2 Costs that may appear fixed with respect to a sin-
gle volume-based cost driver, such as process hours, may be variable with respect to
some other cost driver. The activity-based costing approach also can be used as the
basis for a flexible budget for planning and cost management purposes. Exhibit 11–11
displays an activity-based flexible budget for DCdesserts.com , using the same data as
Exhibit 11–3 .
Compare the conventional flexible budget ( Exhibit 11–3 ) and the activity-based flex-
ible budget ( Exhibit 11–11 ). The key difference lies in the costs that were categorized as
fixed on the conventional flexible budget. These costs are fixed with respect to process
hours but are not fixed with respect to other more appropriate cost drivers. For example,
cost pool II includes inspection and setup costs, which vary with respect to the number
of production runs.

A. T. Kearney To summarize, activity-based flexible budgeting provides a richer view of cost behav-
ior and the underlying cost drivers, and it provides a valuable tool for cost management.
Flexible Budgeting in the Service Industry
All kinds of organizations benefit from the concept of a flexible budget. Like manufac-
turing firms, service-industry organizations incur overhead costs that vary with appro-
priately chosen cost drivers. At Cornell University, for example, the cost of operating
the admissions department depends in part on the number of applicants. At GEICO
Insurance Company, the cost of administering the claims department depends in part
on the number of claims. At the Mayo Clinic, the cost of operating the patient records
department depends in part on the number of patients.

Some operating expenses (cost pool I in the flexible budget) vary with the number of
miles driven by the rental cars. Automobile maintenance and tire replacement expenses
increase as the cars drive more miles. Similarly, such operating expenses as insurance
and leasing costs increase with the number of miles driven, because the company needs
more cars on hand. Other operating expenses (cost pool II) vary with the number of cus-
tomer contracts, regardless of how many miles each customer drives a rental car. Such
expenses as rental reservations, filling out contracts, and cleaning up a rental car upon
return depend on the number of times the cars are rented. Finally, some fixed operating
expenses (cost pool III), such as the office managers’ salaries and rental charges on the
office locations, do not vary with any cost driver.
Upstate Auto Rentals’ management can use this flexible budget to predict operating
expenses at varying levels of activity, as measured by the two cost drivers.

Chapter Summary
LO1 Distinguish between static and flexible budgets and explain the advantages of a flexible over-
head budget. A static budget is based on a single, predicted volume of production activity. A flexible
budget allows for many possible activity levels. The flexible overhead budget is based on some activity
measure that varies in a pattern similar to that of variable overhead. The managerial accountant uses the
amount of overhead cost specified by the flexible budget, given actual output, as a benchmark against
which to compare actual overhead costs.
LO2 Prepare a flexible overhead budget, using both a formula and a columnar format. A colum-
nar flexible budget is based on several distinct activity levels, while a formula flexible budget is valid
for a continuous range of activity. The flexible overhead budget is based on some activity measure that
varies in a pattern similar to that of variable overhead.
LO3 Explain how overhead is applied to Work-in-Process Inventory under standard costing. The
amount of overhead cost entered into Work-in-Process Inventory is equal to the standard overhead rate
multiplied by the standard allowed amount of the activity base, given actual output.
LO4 Explain some important issues in choosing an activity measure for overhead budgeting and
application. The flexible overhead budget is based on some activity measure that varies in a pattern
similar to that of variable overhead. Machine hours, process time, and direct-labor hours are common
activity bases.
LO5 Compute and interpret the variable-overhead spending and efficiency variances and the
fixed overhead budget and volume variances. The variable-overhead spending variance calculates
the effect on production cost of deviations between the actual and standard variable overhead rates. The
variable-overhead efficiency variance calculates the effect on production cost of deviations between
actual and standard amounts of the cost driver, multiplied by the standard variable overhead rate. The
fixed overhead budget variance calculates the effect on production cost of deviations between actual
and budgeted fixed overhead. The fixed overhead volume variance calculates the effect of deviations
between budgeted and applied fixed overhead.
LO6 Prepare an overhead cost performance report. The overhead cost performance report shows
the actual and budgeted costs for each overhead item, along with the four overhead variances: the
variable-overhead spending and efficiency variances, and the fixed-overhead budget and volume
variances. These variances help management to control overhead costs.
LO7 Explain how an activity-based flexible budget differs from a conventional flexible budget. In
an activity-based flexible budget, each overhead item may have a different cost driver identified upon
which the flexible overhead budget for that cost item is based. Such a flexible budget is more accurate

than conventional flexible budgets, because multiple cost drivers are identified to explain the behavior
of overhead costs.
LO8 Prepare journal entries to record manufacturing overhead under standard costing (Appen-
dix A). The left (debit) side of the manufacturing overhead account accumulates actual overhead costs
incurred. The right (credit) side of the overhead account records manufacturing overhead applied to
Work-in-Process Inventory. The cumulative difference between the amounts on the left and right sides
of the overhead account is equal to the sum of the four overhead variances.
LO9 Compute and interpret the sales-price and sales-volume variances (Appendix B). The
sales-price variance is the difference between the actual and budgeted sales prices multiplied by the
actual sales volume. This variance measures the effect on sales revenue of sales price deviations.
The sales-volume variance is the difference between the actual and budgeted sales volumes multiplied
by the budgeted sales price. This variance measures the effect on sales revenue of deviations in sales
volume.

manufacturing-overhead costs of $50,750, which includes $34,650 of variable overhead and $16,100 of
fixed overhead. A summary journal entry to record these actual expenditures follows.

482 Chapter 11 Flexible Budgeting and the Management of Overhead and Support Activity Costs
Manufacturing Overhead ............................................................................................. 50,750
Indirect-Material Inventory ................................................................................... 23,290*
Wages Payable ................................................................................................... 20,610*
Utilities Payable .................................................................................................. 4,960
Accumulated Depreciation ................................................................................... 500
Prepaid Insurance and Property Taxes .................................................................. 100
Test Kitchen Salaries Payable .............................................................................. 1,290
*The credit amounts can be verifi ed in column (4) of Exhibit 11–10. For example, indirect-material costs amounted to $23,290
($12,700 # $2,090 # $2,000 # $6,500). The credit to Wages Payable is for indirect-labor costs, which amounted to $20,610
($6,400 # $2,210 # $7,000 # $3,000 # $2,000).
The application of manufacturing overhead to Work-in-Process Inventory is based on a predeter-
mined overhead rate of $7.00 per process hour (the total of the variable and the fixed rates) and 6,000
standard allowed process hours, given an actual output of 2,000 multilayered fancy cakes. The summary
journal entry is as follows:
Work-in-Process Inventory ........................................................................................... 42,000
Manufacturing Overhead ..................................................................................... 42,000*
*Applied overhead " $7.00 ! 6,000 " $42,000
Now the Manufacturing Overhead account appears as follows:
Manufacturing Overhead
Actual $50,750 $42,000 Applied
The underapplied overhead for September is $8,750 ($50,750 $ $42,000). This means that the
overhead applied to Work-in-Process Inventory in September was $8,750 less than the actual overhead
cost incurred. Notice that the underapplied overhead is equal to the sum of the four overhead variances
for September. The total of the four overhead variances will always be equal to the overapplied or under-
applied overhead for the accounting period.4
Disposition of Variances As explained in the preceding chapter, variances are temporary accounts, and
most companies close them directly into Cost of Goods Sold at the end of each accounting period. The
journal entry required to close out DCdesserts.com’s underapplied overhead for September is as follows:
Cost of Goods Sold ....................................................................................................... 8,750
Manufacturing Overhead ..................................................................................... 8,750
The journal entry to close out underapplied or overapplied overhead typically is made annually, rather
than monthly.
An alternative accounting treatment is to prorate underapplied or overapplied overhead among Work-
in-Process Inventory, Finished-Goods Inventory, and Cost of Goods Sold, as explained in Chapter 3.
A Note on Perishable Products and JIT Production Management Systems As noted in the pre-
ceding chapter, traditional manufacturing systems typically exhibit the cost flows explained in this sec-
tion. Direct-material, direct-labor, and manufacturing-overhead costs are entered in Work-in-Process
Inventory, from which they flow into Finished-Goods Inventory when the goods are finished, and then
on into Cost of Goods Sold. Since DCdesserts.com produces perishable goods, which are produced and
sold on the same day, a simpler procedure could be used. In DCdesserts.com’s case, the standard costs
of direct material, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead could be entered directly into Cost of Goods
Sold as they are incurred. This simplified procedure could be used, because the production process is
very short and the goods are sold immediately. Thus, there is never any work-in-process inventory or
finished-goods inventory on hand. Such situations are common with producers of perishable goods.
4 Overapplied and underapplied manufacturing overhead are discussed in Chapter 3.

Chapter 11 Flexible Budgeting and the Management of Overhead and Support Activity Costs 483
An analogous situation occurs in manufacturers that employ a just-in-time (JIT) production and
inventory control system. In a JIT environment, raw materials are delivered just in time to be entered
into production, and parts or components are manufactured in each stage of the production process just
in time for the next production stage. Thus, like the case of perishable goods, there is little or no work-
in-process or finished-goods inventory at any given time in a JIT environment. For this reason, many
manufacturers that employ the JIT approach make use of highly simplified cost accounting procedures
similar to those explained in the preceding paragraph for DCdesserts.com .
APPENDIX B TO CHAPTER 11
Sales Variances
The variances discussed in Chapters 10 and 11 focus on production costs. Managerial accountants also
compute variances to help management analyze the firm’s sales performance. To illustrate two com- Learning Objective 9
monly used sales variances, we will continue our discussion of DCdesserts.com . The expected sales Compute and interpret the
price and standard variable cost for a multilayered fancy cake are as follows: sales-price and sales-volume
variances.
Budgeted sales price .............................................................................................................................................. $38
Standard variable costs:
Direct material ................................................................................................................................................... $ 7
Direct labor ....................................................................................................................................................... 10
Variable overhead (3 process hours at $5 per hour) ............................................................................................. 15
Total unit variable cost ........................................................................................................................................ $32
The difference between the sales price and the unit variable cost is called the u nit contribution
margin. DCdesserts.com’s unit contribution margin is $6 per multilayered fancy cake ($38 $ $32). This
is the amount that the sale of one multilayered fancy cake contributes toward covering the company’s
fixed costs and making a profit.
During October, DCdesserts.com’s management expects to sell 1,500 multilayered fancy cakes.
Based on this sales forecast, the controller computed the following budgeted t otal contribution margin.
Budgeted sales revenue (1,500 multilayered fancy cakes ! $38) ...................................................................... $57,000
Budgeted variable costs (1,500 multilayered fancy cakes ! $32) ...................................................................... 48,000
Budgeted total contribution margin (1,500 multilayered fancy cakes ! $6) ........................................................ $ 9,000
The actual results for October were as follows:
Actual sales volume .................................................................................................................................. 1,600 cakes
Actual sales price ...................................................................................................................................... $37
Actual unit variable cost ............................................................................................................................ $32
Using these actual results, the actual total contribution margin for October is as follows:
Actual sales revenue (1,600 multilayered fancy cakes ! $37) .......................................................................... $59,200
Actual variable costs (1,600 multilayered fancy cakes ! $32) ........................................................................... 51,200
Actual total contribution margin (1,600 multilayered fancy cakes ! $5) ............................................................. $ 8,000
DCdesserts’ actual and budgeted results for October are summarized in the following table. Notice
that actual sales revenue exceeded budgeted sales revenue by $2,200. However, this favorable vari-
ance was more than offset by the additional $3,200 in variable costs resulting from actual sales volume
exceeding budgeted sales volume. So the actual total contribution margin was $1,000 less than the bud-
geted total contribution margin, as the table shows.

Revenue .......................................... $57,000 $59,200 $2,200 F
Variable costs .................................. 48,000 51,200 3,200 U

484 Chapter 11 Flexible Budgeting and the Management of Overhead and Support Activity Costs
The managerial accountant computes two sales variances to explain the $2,200 favorable variance
in sales revenue. These variances are defined and computed as follows:
A c tu al B ud ge ted
Sales-price variance " sa le s $ sal es ! Actual sales volume
price price
" a ($37 $ $38) b ! 1,600
" $1,600 Unfavorable

Sales-volume variance " sa le s $ sal es ! Budgeted sales price
volume volume
" a (1,600 $ 1,500) b ! $38
" $3,800 Favorable
Together, the s ales-price and s ales-volume variances explain the $2,200 favorable variance
between actual and budgeted sales revenue.
Sales-price variance ......................................................................................................................... $1,600 Unfavorable
Sales-volume variance ..................................................................................................................... 3,800 Favorable
Variance between actual and budgeted sales revenue ........................................................................ $2,200 Favorable
We have only just introduced sales variance analysis here. This topic is covered more extensively

Fletcher called in the company’s new controller, Susan Porter, to discuss the implications of the
variances reported for November and to plan a strategy for improving performance. Porter suggested
that the company’s reporting format might not be giving Fletcher a true picture of the company’s opera-
tions. She proposed that SoftGro implement flexible budgeting. Porter offered to redo the Monthly
Selling Expense Report for November using flexible budgeting so that Fletcher could compare the two
reports and see the advantages of flexible budgeting.
Porter discovered the following information about the behavior of SoftGro’s selling expenses.
• The total compensation paid to the sales force consists of a monthly base salary and a commission;
the commission varies with sales dollars.
• Sales office expense is a semivariable cost with the variable portion related to the number of orders
processed. The fixed portion of office expense is $3,000,000 annually and is incurred uniformly
throughout the year.
• Subsequent to the adoption of the annual budget for the current year, SoftGro decided to open
a new sales territory. As a consequence, approval was given to hire six additional salespeople
effective November 1. Porter decided that these additional six people should be recognized in her
revised report.
• Per diem reimbursement to the sales force, while a fixed amount per day, is variable with the num-
ber of sales personnel and the number of days spent traveling. SoftGro’s original budget was based
on an average sales force of 90 people throughout the year with each salesperson traveling 15 days
per month.
• The company’s shipping expense is a semivariable cost with the variable portion, $3.00 per unit,
dependent on the number of units sold. The fixed portion is incurred uniformly throughout the year.

When the master budget was prepared, LawnMate’s cost accountant, Joan Ballard, supplied the fol-
lowing unit costs: direct material, $60; direct labor, $44; variable overhead, $36; and variable selling, $12.
The total variable costs of $780,000 for May include $320,000 for direct material, $192,000 for
direct labor, $176,000 for variable overhead, and $92,000 for variable selling expenses. Ballard believes
that LawnMate’s monthly reports would be more meaningful to everyone if the company adopted flex-

While distributing the monthly reports at the meeting, McKinley remarked to Clark, “We need to
talk about getting your division back on track. Be sure to see me after the meeting.”
Clark had been so convinced that his division did well in November that McKinley’s remark was a
real surprise. He spent the balance of the meeting avoiding the looks of his fellow managers and trying
to figure out what could have gone wrong. The monthly performance report was no help.
Required:
1. a. Identify three weaknesses in WoodCrafts, Inc.’s monthly Bookcase Production Performance
Report.
b. Discuss the behavioral implications of Sara McKinley’s remarks to Steve Clark during the
meeting.
2. WoodCrafts, Inc. could do a better job of reporting monthly performance to the production
managers.
a. Recommend how the report could be improved to eliminate weaknesses, and revise it accordingly.
b. Discuss how the recommended changes in reporting are likely to affect Steve Clark’s behavior.

Rutherford develops flexible budgets for different levels of activity for use in evaluating perfor-
mance. A total of 6,200 units was produced during 20x1, requiring 32,000 machine hours. The preced-
ing manufacturing cost report compares the company’s actual cost for the year with the static budget and
the flexible budget for two different activity levels.
Required: Compute the following amounts. For variances, indicate whether favorable or unfavorable
where appropriate. Answers should be rounded to two decimal places when necessary.
1. The standard number of machine hours allowed to produce one unit of product.
2. The actual cost of direct material used in one unit of product.
3. The cost of material that should be processed per machine hour.
4. The standard direct-labor cost for each unit produced.
5. The variable-overhead rate per machine hour in a flexible-budget formula. (H int: Use the high-
low method to estimate cost behavior.)
6. The standard fixed-overhead rate per machine hour used for product costing.
7. The variable-overhead spending variance. (Assume management has determined that the actual
fixed overhead cost in 20x1 amounted to $324,000.)
8. The variable-overhead efficiency variance.
9. The fixed-overhead budget variance.
10. The fixed-overhead volume variance. [Make the same assumption as in requirement (7).]
11. The total budgeted manufacturing cost (in thousands of dollars) for an output of 6,050 units.

FOCUS COMPANY >>>
THIS CHAPTER’S FOCUS COMPANY is Aloha Hotels
and Resorts, a chain of luxury hotels and
resorts in Hawaii. In this chapter, we will explore this
hospitality company’s responsibility-accounting system.
Responsibility accounting refers to the various con-
cepts and tools used to measure the performance of
both people and departments in an organization. The
management of Aloha Hotels and Resorts uses detailed
performance reports about the company’s divisions,
hotels, and departments to help ensure that everyone in the
organization is working toward the same overall corporate goals.

goals. G oal congruence results when the managers of subunits throughout an organiza-
tion strive to achieve the goals set by top management.
How can an organization’s managerial accounting system promote goal congruence?
Responsibility accounting refers to the various concepts and tools used by managerial
accountants to measure the performance of people and departments in order to foster goal
congruence.
Responsibility Centers
The basis of a responsibility-accounting system is the designation of each subunit in the

a profit center, and an invest-
ment center. Cost Center A c ost center is an organizational subunit, such as a department or
division, whose manager is held accountable for the costs incurred in the subunit. The
Painting Department in an automobile plant is an example of a cost center.
Revenue Center The manager of a revenue center is held accountable for the
revenue attributed to the subunit. For example, the Reservations Department of an airline
and the Sales Department of a manufacturer are revenue centers.
Profit Center A profit center is an organizational subunit whose manager is held
accountable for profit. Since profit is equal to revenue minus expenses, profit-center

managers are held accountable for both the revenue and expenses attributed to their subunits.
An example of a profit center is a company-owned restaurant in a fast-food chain.
Investment Center The manager of an i nvestment center is held accountable
for the subunit’s profit and the invested capital used by the subunit to generate its profit.
A division of a large corporation is typically designated as an investment center.1
Illustration of Responsibility Accounting
To illustrate the concepts used in responsibility accounting, we will focus on a hotel chain.
Aloha Hotels and Resorts operates 10 luxury hotels in the state of Hawaii. The company is
divided into the Maui Division, which operates seven hotels on the island of Maui, and the
Oahu Division, with three properties on the island of Oahu. Exhibit 12–1 shows the com-
pany’s organization chart, and Exhibit 12–2 depicts the responsibility-accounting system.
This aircraft maintenance department is a cost center. The telemarketing operation shown here is a revenue center. This
Applebee’s in upstate New York is a profit center. The power plant in the Loire Valley, France is an investment center.
What sort of responsibility center designation would be appropriate for your local carwash, hair salon, and laundromat?
1 Although there is an important conceptual difference between profit centers and investment centers, the latter term
is not always used in practice. Some managers use the term p rofit center to refer to both types of responsibility cen-
ters. Hence, when businesspeople use the term p rofit center, they may be referring to a true profit center (as defined
in this chapter) or to an investment center.

Division Level The vice president of the Oahu Division is accountable for the
profit earned by the three resort hotels on Oahu in relation to the capital invested in
those properties. Hence, the Oahu Division is also an investment center. The vice presi-
dent has the authority to make major investment decisions regarding the properties on
Oahu, up to a limit of $300,000. For example, the vice president could decide to land-
scape a swimming pool at one of the Oahu resort hotels, but could not decide to add a
new wing.
Hotel Level The Waikiki Sands Hotel, in Honolulu, is one of the properties in
the Oahu Division. The general manager of the Waikiki Sands Hotel is accountable
for the profit earned by the hotel. The general manager does not have the authority
to make major investment decisions, but is responsible for operational decisions. For
example, the general manager hires all of the hotel’s departmental managers, sets wage
rates, determines procedures and standards for operations, approves decorating deci-
sions, and generally oversees the hotel’s operation. Since the hotel’s general manager
has no authority to make major investment decisions, she is held accountable only for

mance report help managers use m anagement by exception to control an organization’s
operations effectively.
The performance report for the kitchen of the Waikiki Sands Hotel for February is
shown in the Excel spreadsheet in E xhibit 12–3 .
As the organization chart in Exhibit 12–1 shows, Aloha Hotels and Resorts is a
hierarchy. Each subunit manager reports to one higher-level manager, from the head chef
all the way up to the president. In such an organization, there is also a hierarchy of perfor-
mance reports, since the performance of each subunit constitutes part of the performance
of the next higher-level subunit. For example, the cost performance in the kitchen of the
Waikiki Sands Hotel constitutes part of the profit performance of the hotel’s Food and
Beverage Department.
Exhibit 12–4 shows the relationships between the February performance reports for
several subunits of Aloha Hotels and Resorts. Notice that the numbers for the Grounds
and Maintenance Department, the Housekeeping and Custodial Department, and the
Kitchen are in parentheses. These subunits are cost centers, so the numbers shown are
expenses. All of the other subunits shown in Exhibit 12–4 are either profit centers or
investment centers. The numbers shown for these subunits are profits, so they are not
enclosed in parentheses. In addition to the profit figures shown, the performance reports
for the investment centers should include data about invested capital. The Maui Division,
the Oahu Division, and the company as a whole are investment centers. Performance
evaluation in investment centers is covered in the next chapter.
Notice the relationships between the performance reports in Exhibit 12–4 . The
kitchen is the lowest-level subunit shown, and its performance report is the same as that

tionships emphasized with arrows in Exhibit 12–4 .
The hierarchy of performance reports starts at the bottom and builds toward the top,
just as the organization structure depicted in E xhibit 12–1 builds from the bottom upward.
Each manager in the organization receives the performance report for his or her own sub-
unit in addition to the performance reports for the major subunits in the next lower level.
For example, the general manager of the Waikiki Sands Hotel receives the reports for the
hotel, and each of its departments: Grounds and Maintenance, Housekeeping and Custo-
dial, Recreational Services, Hospitality, and Food and Beverage. With these reports, the
hotel’s general manager can evaluate her subordinates as well as her own performance.
This will help the general manager in improving the hotel’s performance, motivating
employees, and planning future operations.

for the Waikiki Sands Hotel are the joint result of all of the hotel’s activities. One func-
Use a cost allocation base to tion of a responsibility-accounting system is to assign all of an organization’s costs to the
allocate costs. subunits that cause them to be incurred.
A collection of costs to be assigned is called a c ost pool. At the Waikiki Sands Hotel,
for example, all utility costs are combined into a utility cost pool, which includes the
costs of electricity, water, sewer, trash collection, television cable, and telephone. The
responsibility centers, products, or services to which costs are to be assigned are called
cost objects. The Waikiki Sands’ cost objects are its major departments. (See the orga-
nization chart in Exhibit 12–1 .) The process of assigning the costs in the cost pool to the
cost objects is called cost allocation or cost distribution.
Cost Allocation Bases
To distribute (or allocate) costs to responsibility centers, the managerial accountant
chooses an a llocation base for each cost pool. An allocation base is a measure of activ-
ity, physical characteristic, or economic characteristic that is associated with the respon-
sibility centers, which are the cost objects in the allocation process. The allocation base
chosen for a cost pool should reflect some characteristic of the various responsibility
centers that is related to the incurrence of costs. An allocation base also may be referred
to as a cost driver.
Exhibit 12–5 shows the Waikiki Sands Hotel’s February cost distribution for selected
cost pools. Each cost pool is distributed to each responsibility center in proportion to
that center’s relative amount of the allocation base. For example, the Food and Beverage
Department receives 30 percent of the total administrative costs, $25,000, because that
department’s 36 employees constitute 30 percent of the hotel’s employees. Notice that no
marketing costs are allocated to either the Grounds and Maintenance Department or the
Housekeeping and Custodial Department. Neither of these responsibility centers gener-
ates any sales revenue.
Allocation Bases Based on Budgets
At the Waikiki Sands Hotel, administrative and marketing costs are distributed on
the basis of budgeted amounts of the relevant allocation bases, rather than actual

amounts. The managerial accountant should design an allocation procedure so that Responsibility Centers:
the behavior of one responsibility center does not affect the costs allocated to other Waikiki Sands Hotel
responsibility centers.
Suppose, for example, that the budgeted and actual February sales revenues for the
hotel were as shown in Exhibit 12–6 . Notice that the Hospitality Department’s actual
sales revenue is close to the budget. However, the actual sales of the Recreational Services
Department and the Food and Beverage Department are substantially below the budget.
If the distribution of marketing costs is based on actual sales, instead of budgeted sales,
then the cost distributed to the Hospitality Department jumps from $40,000 to $45,000,
an increase of 12.5 percent. Why does this happen? As a result of a sales performance
substantially below the budget for the o ther two departments, the Hospitality Department
is penalized with a hefty increase in its cost distribution. This is misleading and unfair to
the Hospitality Department manager. A preferable cost distribution procedure is to use
budgeted sales revenue as the allocation base, rather than actual sales revenue. Then the
marketing costs distributed to each department do not depend on the performance in the
other two departments.

514 Chapter 12 Responsibility Accounting, Quality Control, and Environmental Cost Management
Activity-Based Responsibility Accounting
Traditional responsibility-accounting systems tend to focus on the financial per-
formance measures of cost, revenue, and profit for the s ubunits of an organization.
Contemporary cost management systems, however, are beginning to focus more and
more on activities. Costs are incurred in organizations and their subunits because of
activities. Activity-based costing (ABC) systems associate costs with the activities that
drive those costs. The database created by an ABC system, coupled with nonfinancial
measures of operational performance for each activity, enables management to employ
activity-based responsibility accounting. Under this approach, management’s atten-
tion is directed not only to the cost incurred in an activity but also to the activity itself.
Is the activity necessary? Does it add value to the organization’s product or service?
Can the activity be improved? By seeking answers to these questions, managers can
eliminate non-value-added activities and increase the cost-effectiveness of the activities
that do add value. 2
Behavioral Effects of Responsibility Accounting
Responsibility-accounting systems can influence behavior significantly. Whether the
behavioral effects are positive or negative, however, depends on how responsibility
accounting is implemented.
Information versus Blame
The proper focus of a responsibility-accounting system is i nformation. The system should
identify the individual in the organization who is in the best position to explain each par-
ticular event or financial result. The emphasis should be on providing that individual
and higher-level managers with information to help them understand the reasons behind
the organization’s performance. When properly used, a responsibility-accounting system
does not emphasize blame. If managers feel they are beaten over the head with criticism
and rebukes when unfavorable variances occur, they are unlikely to respond in a positive
way. Instead, they will tend to undermine the system and view it with skepticism. But
when the responsibility-accounting system emphasizes its informational role, managers
tend to react constructively, and strive for improved performance.
Controllability
“Distinguishing between

Chapter 12 Responsibility Accounting, Quality Control, and Environmental Cost Management 515
Motivating Desired Behavior
Managerial accountants often use the responsibility-accounting system to motivate
actions considered desirable by upper-level management. Sometimes the responsibility-
accounting system can solve behavioral problems as well. As a case in point, consider the
problem of rush orders. To accept or reject a rush order is a cost-benefit decision:
Costs of Accepting Rush Order Benefits of Accepting Rush Order
Disrupted production Satisfied customers
More setups Greater future sales
Higher costs
The following real-world example involving rush orders provides a case in point.
The production scheduler in a manufacturing firm was frequently asked to interrupt
production of one product with a rush order for another product. Rush orders typically
resulted in greater costs because more product setups were required. Since the production
scheduler was evaluated on the basis of costs, he was reluctant to accept rush orders. The
sales manager, on the other hand, was evaluated on the basis of sales revenue. By agreeing
to customers’ demands for rush orders, the sales manager satisfied his customers. This
resulted in more future sales and favorable performance ratings for the sales manager.
As the rush orders became more and more frequent, the production manager began
to object. The sales manager responded by asking if the production scheduler wanted
to take the responsibility for losing a customer by refusing a rush order. The production
scheduler did not want to be blamed for lost sales, so he grudgingly accepted the rush
orders. However, considerable ill will developed between the sales manager and produc-
tion scheduler.
The company’s managerial accountant came to the rescue by redesigning the
responsibility-accounting system. The system was modified to accumulate the extra costs
associated with rush orders and charge them to the sales manager’s responsibility cen-
ter, rather than the production scheduler’s center. The ultimate result was that the sales
manager chose more carefully which rush-order requests to make, and the production
manager accepted them gracefully.
The problem described in the preceding illustration developed because two different
managers were considering the costs and benefits of the rush-order decision. The produc-
tion manager was looking only at the costs, while the sales manager was looking only
at the benefits. The modified responsibility-accounting system made the sales manager
look at both the costs and the benefits associated with each rush order. Then the sales
manager could make the necessary trade-off between costs and benefits in considering
each rush order. Some rush orders were rejected, because the sales manager decided the
costs exceeded the benefits. Other rush orders were accepted, when the importance of the
customer and potential future sales justified it.
This example illustrates how a well-designed responsibility-accounting system can
make an organization run more smoothly and achieve higher performance.
Segmented Reporting
Subunits of an organization are often called s egments. Segmented reporting refers to the
preparation of accounting reports by segment and for the organization as a whole. Many Learning Objective 5
organizations prepare s egmented income statements, which show the income for major Prepare a segmented income
segments and for the entire enterprise. statement.
In preparing segmented income statements, the managerial accountant must decide
how to treat costs that are incurred to benefit more than one segment. Such costs are called
common costs. The salary of the president of Aloha Hotels and Resorts is a common cost.
The president manages the entire company. Some of her time is spent on matters related

is so much more information segments, they can be allocated to segments only on the basis of some highly arbitrary
there.” (12e) allocation base. Consider the salary of Aloha Hotels and Resorts’ president. What allo-
Qwest cation base would you choose to reflect the contribution of the president’s managerial
efforts to the company’s two divisions? The possible allocation bases include budgeted
divisional sales revenue, the number of hotels or employees in each division, or some
measure of divisional size, such as total assets. However, all of these allocation bases
would yield arbitrary cost allocations and possibly misleading segment profit informa-
tion. For this reason, many organizations choose not to allocate common costs on seg-
mented income statements.
Exhibit 12–7 shows February’s segmented income statement (on a budgeted basis)
for Aloha Hotels and Resorts. Each segment’s income statement is presented in the con-
tribution format discussed in Chapter 8. Notice that Exhibit 12–7 shows income state-
ments for the following segments.
Maui Division Waimea Beach Resort
Aloha Hotels and Resorts  
Oahu Diivision Diamond Head LLodge
 Waikiki Sands Hotel
Three numbers in Exhibit 12–7 require special emphasis. First, the $10,000,000 of
common fixed expenses in the left-hand column is not allocated to the company’s two
divisions. Included in this figure are such costs as the company president’s salary. These
costs cannot be allocated to the divisions, except in some arbitrary manner.
Second, $1,000,000 of controllable fixed expense in the right-hand column constitutes
part of the Oahu Division’s $9,000,000 of controllable fixed expense. All $9,000,000 of
expense is controllable by the vice president of the Oahu Division. However, $1,000,000
of these expenses cannot be traced to the division’s three hotels, except on an arbitrary
basis. For example, this $1,000,000 of expense includes the salary of the Oahu Division’s
vice president. Therefore, the $1,000,000 of expense is not allocated among the divi-
sion’s three hotels. This procedure illustrates an important point. Costs that are traceable
to segments at one level in an organization may become common costs at a lower level
in the organization. The vice president’s salary is traceable to the Oahu Division, but it
cannot be allocated among the division’s three hotels except arbitrarily. Thus, the vice
president’s salary is a traceable cost at the divisional level, but it becomes a common cost
at the hotel level.
Third, the $200,000,000 of fixed expenses controllable by others in the right-hand
column constitutes part of the Oahu Division’s $250,000,000 of fixed expenses control-
lable by others. However, the $200,000,000 portion cannot be allocated among the divi-
sion’s three hotels, except arbitrarily.
Segments versus Segment Managers
One advantage of segmented reports like the one in Exhibit 12–7 is that they make a
distinction between segments and segment managers. Some costs that are traceable to
a segment may be completely beyond the influence of the segment manager. Property
taxes on the Waikiki Sands Hotel, for example, are traceable to the hotel, but the hotel’s
general manager cannot influence them. To properly evaluate the Waikiki Sands Hotel as
an investment of the company’s resources, the property taxes should be included in the
hotel’s costs. However, in evaluating the general manager’s performance, the property-tax
cost should be excluded, since the manager has no control over it.

To summarize, Exhibit 12–7 illustrates three important characteristics of segmented reporting: Resorts (in thousands)
1. Contribution format. These income statements use the contribution format.
The statements subtract variable expenses from sales revenue to obtain the
contribution margin.
2. Controllable versus uncontrollable expenses. The income statements in
Exhibit 12–7 highlight the costs that can be controlled, or heavily influenced,
by each segment manager. This approach is consistent with r esponsibility
accounting.
3. Segmented income statement. S egmented reporting shows income statements
for the company as a whole and for its major segments.
Customer-Profitability Analysis and Activity-Based Costing
Analyzing profitability by segments of the company can help managers gain insight into
the factors that are driving the company’s performance. In addition to focusing on the
major organizational subunits in the company, profitability analysis can focus on major
market segments, geographical regions, distribution channels, or customers.
Customer-profitability analysis uses the concept of activity-based costing to deter-
mine how serving particular customers causes activities to be performed and costs to be
incurred. Suppose, for example, that customer A frequently changes its orders after they
are placed, but customer B typically does not. Then the costs incurred in updating sales
orders for changes should be recorded in a manner that reflects the fact that customer A
is more responsible for those activities and costs than is customer B.
Many factors can result in some customers being more profitable than others.
Customers that order in small quantities, order frequently, often change their orders,

require special packaging or handling, demand faster delivery, or need special parts
or engineering design generally are less profitable than customers who demand less in
terms of customized services. If managers have a good understanding of which custom-
ers are generating the greatest profit, they can make more-informed decisions about
customer service. Moreover, customers can be educated as to the costs they are causing
by demanding special services. In many cases, customers’ behavior can be changed in
a way that reduces costs to the supplier. Then these cost savings can be shared by the
supplier and the customer. (Customer-profitability analysis is covered more extensively
in Chapter 6.)
Total Quality Management
Traditional responsibility-accounting systems focus primarily on the financial
performance of an organization’s subunits. However, nowadays it is crucial for
organizations to monitor performance in many nonfinancial areas as well. For many
companies, quality is at the forefront of the areas in which nonfinancial performance is
critically important. The quality of the product or service that an organization provides
can spell the difference between future profitability and disaster. Quality is equally
important in the service and manufacturing industries. For Aloha Hotels and Resorts,
the quality of service includes the comfort of the guest rooms, the amenities provided
to guests, the friendliness of the staff, the quality of food served in the restaurant, and
so forth. Hotel guests are ever more discriminating as they assess the overall quality of
service and then select their accommodations accordingly. Similar comments apply to
the airlines, long-distance telecommunications companies, banks, car rental firms, and
financial investment firms.
In the manufacturing industry, product quality has become a key factor in deter-
mining a firm’s success or failure in the global marketplace. Advanced, highly reliable
manufacturing methods have made it possible to achieve very high standards of product
quality. As a result, more and more firms are making product quality a keystone of their
competitive strategy.
Measuring and Reporting Quality Costs
Recognizing the importance of maintaining high product quality, companies often mea-

sure and report the costs of doing so. Before we examine the costs that companies incur
Prepare a quality-cost report. to maintain high product quality, let’s consider what product quality means.
Product Quality What is meant by a high-quality product? There are two concepts
of quality that determine a product’s degree of excellence or the product’s ultimate fitness
for its intended use. A product’s g rade refers to the extent of its capability in performing
its intended purpose, in relation to other products with the same functional use. For
example, a computer monitor that displays 65,536 colors is of a higher grade than a
monitor that displays only 256 colors. A product’s quality of design refers to how well
it is conceived or designed for its intended use. For example, a coffee mug designed with
a handle that is too small for the user’s fingers is a poorly designed mug. The q uality
of conformance refers to the extent to which a product meets the specifications of its
design. A coffee mug with an appropriately sized handle could be well designed, but if
the handle breaks off due to shoddy manufacturing, it will be useless. This mug fails to
conform to its design specifications. Both quality of design and quality of conformance
are required in order to achieve a high-quality finished product.
Costs of Quality Due to the increasing importance of maintaining high product
quality, many companies routinely measure and report the costs of ensuring high quality.
Four types of costs are monitored.

First are prevention costs, the costs of preventing defects. Second are appraisal costs,
the costs of determining whether defects exist. The third type of costs are internal failure
costs, those costs of repairing defects found prior to product delivery. The last type of costs
are e xternal failure costs, those costs incurred after defective products have been delivered.
Exhibit 12–8 shows a quality-cost report prepared by Handico, Inc., a manufacturer
Handic
of cordless telephones.3 As is always true in cost monitoring, quality-cost reporting is
most useful when cost trends are examined over a period of time. Through trend analy-
sis, management can see where improvement is occurring and where difficulties exist.
Goals can be set to achieve a particular cost target in an area of concern. For example,
Handico’s management might strive to reduce warranty costs to zero by a certain date.
Observable versus Hidden Quality Costs The quality costs discussed in
the preceding section are o bservable . They can be measured and reported, often on the
basis of information in the accounting records. In addition to these observable quality
costs, however, companies incur hidden quality costs. When products of inferior quality
make it to market, customers are dissatisfied. Their dissatisfaction can result in decreased

sales and a tarnished reputation for the company. Not only does the company experience
lost sales for the inferior products but it will also likely experience lost sales in its other
product lines. The opportunity cost of these lost sales and decreased market share can
represent a significant hidden cost. Such hidden costs are difficult to estimate or report.
Changing Views of Optimal Product Quality
One way to express product quality is in the percentage of products that fail to conform to
Learning Objective 7
their specifications, that is, the percentage of defects. Given this perspective, what is the
Discuss the traditional and optimal level of product quality?4
contemporary views of the
optimal level of product quality. Traditional Perspective The traditional viewpoint holds that finding the opti-
mal level of product quality is a balancing act between incurring costs of prevention and
appraisal on one hand and incurring costs of failure on the other. Panel A of Exhibit 12–9
depicts this trade-off. As the percentage of defective products decreases, the costs of pre-
vention and appraisal increase. However, the costs of internal and external failure decrease.
Adding the costs of prevention, appraisal, and internal and external failure yields total qual-
ity costs. The optimal product quality level is the point that minimizes total quality costs.
Contemporary Perspective Due largely to the influence of Japanese product
quality expert Genichi Taguchi, the contemporary viewpoint of optimal product quality
differs from the traditional perspective. The contemporary view is that if both observable
and hidden costs of quality are considered, any deviation from a product’s target speci-
fications results in the incurrence of increasing quality costs. Under the contemporary
viewpoint, as depicted in Panel B of Exhibit 12–9 , the optimal level of product quality
occurs at the zero defect level. As Panel B shows, the observable and hidden costs of
internal and external failure increase as the percentage of defective products increases.
The observable and hidden costs of prevention and appraisal increase slightly and then
decrease as the percentage of defects increases. The most important point, though, is that
the total costs of quality are minimized at the zero defect level.
Whether the traditional or contemporary view of optimal product quality is most
accurate is still being debated by quality control experts. Moreover, the exact shape of
the cost functions in Exhibit 12–9 is largely an empirical question, and the cost functions
probably differ among industries and product types. One thing is certain, though. To
compete successfully in today’s global market, any company must pay very close atten-
tion to achieving a very high level of product quality.

Total Quality Management Monitoring product quality coupled with mea-
suring and reporting quality costs helps companies maintain programs of t otal quality
management, or T QM. This refers to the broad set of management and control pro-
cesses designed to focus the entire organization and all of its employees on providing
products or services that do the best possible job of satisfying the customer. Among the
tools used in total quality management is the S ix Sigma program, an analytical method
that aims at achieving near-perfect results in a production process. (See the Management
Accounting Practice illustration on the next page for details.)
Identifying Quality Control Problems An effective TQM program includes
methods for identifying quality control problems. One method of identifying quality “Six Sigma might be the
problems is the cause-and-effect diagram (also called an Ishikawa diagram or a fishbone maturation of everything
diagram). E xhibit 12–10 displays a cause-and-effect diagram used by Xerox Corporation we’ve learned over the past
to identify the causes of errors in its customer billing process. As the diagram shows, 100 years about quality.” (12f)
the quality improvement team has identified a wide range of possible causes for billing President,
errors. After identifying possible causes for billing errors, the Xerox team, nicknamed American Society

Another helpful tool in quality improvement programs is the Pareto diagram.

A ccounting SIX SIGMA FOR QUALITY MANAGEMENT AND COST REDUCTION
P ractice “Originally conceived by M otorola Inc. as a quality-improvement device” two decades ago,
“Six Sigma soon morphed into a cost-cutting utensil for manufacturers of all stripes. Now,

Sigma to functions as varied as accounts receivable, sales, and research and development.
Honeywell
And their success in these nonfactory domains has inspired Six Sigma projects at financial
institutions, retailers, health-care concerns, and in other areas of the service sector.”
Six Sigma is “an analytical method aimed at achieving near-perfect results in a
production process. In statistics, the Greek letter s igma denotes variation in a standard
bell curve. One sigma equals 690,000 defects per 1 million. Most companies do no bet-
ter than three sigma, or 66,000 errors per million. Six Sigma reduces that count to 3.4
defects per million. That saves money by preventing waste.”
Six Sigma “achieves results by reducing subjective errors in the assessment of prob-
lems. First, auditors define a process where results are subpar. Then they m easure the
process to determine current performance, a nalyze this information to pinpoint where
things are going wrong, and improve the process and eliminate the error. Last, c ontrols
are set up to prevent future bugs.”
“In the world of manufacturing, Six Sigma has become something akin to a religion.”
When General Electric ’s former chairman Jack Welch embraced Six Sigma, for example,
“he quickly assembled an unprecedented army of employees to pinpoint and fix prob-
lems throughout GE” using their Six Sigma training. “The results were awesome: In three
years alone, these troops saved the company $8 billion, according to GE.” Now “GE is
sending out its Six Sigma squads to customers such as Dell Inc. and Walmart stores to
help them root out what GE estimates to be more than $1 billion in inefficiencies and
waste—and help GE win more business.” 5
D ow Chemical initiated several Six Sigma projects, each of which saved an average of
a half million dollars in its first year alone. 6 A llied Signal, which uses activity-based costing
in conjunction with its Six Sigma program, saved over $500 million in the program’s first
year.7 Honeywell is using the Six Sigma approach, in conjunction with other productivity
improvements, with a goal of over a billion dollars in cost savings. 8
“Employees charged with Six Sigma duties generally have what’s called a black
belt.” At Allied Signal, for example, “it’s awarded to those employees who complete four
separate weeks of classroom study. In between those weeks of class, black-belt candi-
dates must use what they’ve learned to focus on a project within the company and show
some cost savings achieved by using Six Sigma.”9

ISO 9000 Standards
A key factor in determining the quality of a company’s products is its quality control
system. The organizational structure, personnel, procedures, and policies that are in place
to monitor product quality will greatly affect a firm’s ability to achieve high-quality
standards. In 1987, the International Standards Organization (ISO), based in Geneva,
Switzerland, issued a set of quality control standards for companies selling products in
Europe. The ISO 9000 standards, as they have come to be known, focus on a manufactur-
er’s quality control system. The ISO 9000 standards basically require that a manufacturer
have a well-defined quality control system in place, and that the target level of product
quality be maintained consistently. Moreover, the ISO 9000 standards require a manufac-
turer to prepare extensive documentation of all aspects of the quality control system. The
first standard, ISO 9000, lists three objectives:
• The company should sustain the quality of its product or service at a level that
continually meets the purchaser’s stated or implied needs.
• The quality control system should be sufficient to give the supplier’s own
management confidence that the intended quality is being maintained.
• The supplying company should give the purchaser confidence that the intended
quality is consistently achieved in the delivered product or service.
The ISO 9000 standards have been adopted in the United States as well. The U.S.
government and many large companies are more and more inclined to require their sup-
pliers to have ISO 9000 certification.
The ISO 9000 standards consist of five major parts. ISO 9000 states the objectives of
the standards, defines a quality-related vocabulary, and provides a guide to the other stan-
dards in the series. ISO 9001 provides a model for quality assurance in design, development,
production, installation, and servicing. ISO 9002 focuses narrowly on quality assurance in
production and installation. ISO 9003 addresses quality assurance in final inspection and
testing. Finally, ISO 9004 provides guidelines for the design of a quality assurance system.
Implications for Managerial Accounting The ISO 9000 standards have
several implications for managerial accountants. First, the standards require extensive doc-
umentation of the quality control system. This task often falls to the controller’s office. In
fact, several of the largest public accounting firms are offering assurance services in helping

================================================================================

================================================================================

524 Chapter 12 Responsibility Accounting, Quality Control, and Environmental Cost Management
companies meet the ISO documentation requirements for certification. Second, the ISO
standards require that the costs and benefits of the quality control system be measured and
documented. This means that management accountants will be responsible for measuring
and reporting product life-cycle costs, quality costs, and the effectiveness of efforts at con-
tinuous improvement.
To summarize, the ISO 9000 standards are having a global impact on the way compa-
nies approach their quality assurance objectives. The standards will affect virtually every
area within a firm subject to its guidelines. Managerial accountants will be integrally
involved in the informational and documentation aspects of the ISO 9000 program.1 0

to pay attention to environmental issues, in the United States we have environmental
laws, such as the U.S. Clean Air Act and the U .S. Superfund Act, as well as the federal
watchdog agency, the Environmental Protection Agency (E PA ). On a global scale, there
are environmental initiatives as well, such as the Kyoto Protocol, which seeks to reduce
emissions of greenhouse gases that many scientists believe contribute to global warming.
So, besides being a very important issue to all of us due to the clear health and
quality-of-life implications, what does any of this have to do with managerial account-
ing? The answer is that the costs of dealing with environmental issues in one way or
another are enormous. These environmental costs take many forms, such as installing
scrubbers on a smokestack to comply with EPA regulations, improving a production pro-
cess to reduce or eliminate certain pollutants, or cleaning up a contaminated river. In the
next section, we will systematically explore these costs with the goal of having a better
understanding of how to manage them.
Classifying Environmental Costs
There are many types of environmental costs.
Private versus Social Environmental Costs One important distinction is
between private costs and social (or public) costs. Private environmental costs are those
borne by a company or individual. Examples would be costs incurred by a company to
comply with EPA regulations or to clean up a polluted lake. Social environmental costs
are those borne by the public at large. Examples of these include costs borne by the
taxpayers to staff the EPA; costs borne by the taxpayers to clean up a polluted lake or
river; costs borne by individuals, insurance companies, and Medicare due to health prob-
lems caused by pollutants; and the unquantifiable quality-of-life costs we all bear from a
degraded environment.
The recent tragic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico stemming from an explosion at the
Deepwater Horizon oil rig provides an unfortunate example of both social and private

environmental costs. The social environmental costs associated with this disaster, which
will be borne for years to come, include such costs as cleaning up fouled beaches and
fragile wetlands, severe harm to the gulf states’ recreational and fishing industries, and
possible human health hazards from the hydrocarbons contaminating the Gulf’s waters,
marshes, and beaches. Huge private environmental costs will be borne by the companies
involved in the Deepwater Horizon’s drilling operations, such as BP and its partners.
While these social environmental costs are of great importance to all of us, we will focus
our attention here on environmental cost management, which is the systematic attempt
to measure and control or reduce the private environmental costs borne by a company or
other organization.1 1
Visible versus Hidden Environmental Costs Both social and private environ-
mental costs can be visible or h idden. Visible social environmental costs are those that are
known and clearly identified as tied to environmental issues, such as the taxpayers’ costs of
staffing the EPA or cleaning up a polluted lake. H idden social environmental costs include
those that are caused by environmental issues but have not been so identified, such as the
costs borne by individuals, insurance companies, or Medicare due to cancers caused by pol-
lutants but not clearly identified as such. For example, is melanoma (a serious type of skin
cancer) caused by a familial tendency, failure to use sun block, or a thinning of the ozone
layer resulting from industrial emissions of chlorofluorocarbons? No one knows for sure.
Managing Private Environmental Costs
Let’s focus our attention now on environmental cost management, or the measuring and
control or reduction of private environmental costs.
Visible versus Hidden Private Environmental Costs Once again, we
need to distinguish between visible and hidden costs. V isible private environmental costs
are those that are measurable and have been clearly identified as tied to environmental
issues. H idden private environmental costs are those that are caused by environmental
issues but have not been so identified by the accounting system. 12 Exhibit 12–12 provides
examples of both visible and hidden private environmental costs. 13 Notice that the visible
and the hidden costs listed in Exhibit 12–12 are further classified as follows:
• M onitoring costs. Costs of monitoring the production process to determine if
pollution is being generated (e.g., costs of testing wastewater for contaminants).
• A batement costs. Costs incurred to reduce or eliminate pollution (e.g., changing
a product’s design to use more expensive materials that do not result in environ-
mental contamination).
• R emediation costs (i.e., clean-up costs).
• O n-site remediation. Costs of reducing or preventing the discharge into the
environment of pollutants that have been generated in the production process
(e.g., cost of installing scrubbers on a smokestack to remove certain air
pollutants in the smoke).
• O ff-site remediation. Costs of reducing or eliminating pollutants from the envi-
ronment after they have been discharged (e.g., cost of cleaning up a river pol-
luted by a company’s operations).

*Each of the costs listed in the hidden costs column is included under the assumption that although these costs are caused by environmental con-
cerns, the accounting system has not identified them as such. A study by Joshi et al. provides evidence for the plausibility of this assumption. See
Satish Joshi, Ranjani Krishnan, and Lester Lave, “Estimating the Hidden Costs of Environmental Regulation,” The Accounting Review 76,
no. 2 (April 2001), pp. 171–98.
The distinction between the visible and hidden costs listed in Exhibit 12–12 is an
important but subtle one. Consider, for example, the incremental cost of using a more
expensive material because it causes less (or no) negative environmental impact. Is this
a visible or a hidden cost? The answer is i t depends on whether the accounting system
has measured this cost and identified it as an environmental cost. Studies show that many
environmental costs are hidden, because the accounting system does not measure and
identify them as environmental costs. “Most accounting systems accumulate visible costs
into environmental cost pools, separate from other overhead cost pools . . . For exam-
ple, many steel mills compile separate cost pools for wastewater treatment, remediation,
hazardous waste disposal, pollution-abatement capital expenditures, and depreciation
on pollution abatement equipment.” 14 However, a steel mill’s incremental material costs
caused by changing from sinters to less-polluting pellets in response to more stringent
environmental regulations is typically not separately reported by the accounting system
as an environmental cost.1 5 Hence, it remains a h idden environmental cost.
Why is this point about visible versus hidden costs so important? Because many
observers believe that the visible costs reported by most accounting systems may be only
a small proportion of the hidden costs. A steel-industry study, for example, concluded
that the hidden costs were nearly 10 times the visible costs!

Environmental Cost Strategies
We have only scratched the surface in our discussion of environmental costs, and it is
an area certain to receive much greater attention in the future—both in practice and in
academia. Let’s conclude our discussion with a brief mention of three strategies for man-
aging environmental costs. 1 6
1. End-of-pipe strategy. Under this approach, companies produce the waste or
pollutant, and then clean it up before it is discharged into the environment.
Smokestack scrubbers, wastewater treatment, and carbon air filters are
examples of end-of-pipe strategies.
2. Process improvement strategy. Under this approach, companies modify prod-
ucts and production processes to produce little or no pollutants, or find ways to
recycle wastes internally.
3. Prevention strategy. “The ultimate strategy for maximizing the value of
pollution-related activities involves . . . not producing any pollutants in the
first place. With this strategy, companies avoid all problems with regulatory
authorities and, in many cases, generate significant profit improvements.”1 7
Tie-In to the Responsibility-Accounting System
As a concluding thought, consider why our discussion of environmental costs—and in
the preceding section, quality costs—is located in the chapter covering responsibility
accounting. For any type of cost, an important key to managing or controlling the cost is
to make it someone’s responsibility. “Line managers make the decisions that cause waste
and environmental costs, and these managers should see the financial consequences of
their decisions. Without a tight link between decision makers and environmental costs,
any cost-control efforts will be difficult and prone to failure.”1 8

Chapter Summary
LO1 Explain the role of responsibility accounting in fostering goal congruence. Responsibil-
ity-accounting systems are designed to foster goal congruence among the managers in decentralized
organizations by specifying the performance measures upon which managers of various organizational
subunits will be evaluated.
LO2 Define and give an example of a cost center, a revenue center, a profit center, and an invest-
ment center. A cost center is an organizational subunit, the manager of which is held accountable for
the subunit’s costs. Examples include the assembly department of an auto manufacturer and the main-
tenance department of a hotel. A revenue center is an organizational subunit, the manager of which is
held accountable for the subunit’s revenue. Examples include the sales departments of a cruise line or an
insurance company. A profit center is an organizational subunit, the manager of which is held account-
able for the subunit’s profit. Examples include an individual branch bank or an individual fast food

restaurant. An investment center is an organizational subunit, the manager of which is held accountable
for the relationship between the subunit’s profit and its invested capital. A division of a large corporation
(manufacturing, service, or retail) is usually designated as an investment center.
LO3 Prepare a performance report and explain the relationships between the performance
reports for various responsibility centers. The performance of each of an organization’s responsibility
accounting centers is summarized periodically on a performance report. This report shows the budgeted
and actual performance results for a specified time period for each responsibility accounting center.
LO4 Use a cost allocation base to allocate costs. A cost allocation base is a measure of activity,
physical characteristic, or economic characteristic associated with a group of organizational subunits or
activities, which is the basis for allocating costs among those subunits or activities.
LO5 Prepare a segmented income statement. Segmented income statements often are included in a
responsibility-accounting system to show the performance of the organization and its various segments.
To be most effective, such reports should distinguish between the performance of segments and segment
managers.
LO6 Prepare a quality cost report. As product quality becomes ever more important, many firms are
beginning to carefully monitor the costs of maintaining product quality. Quality costs often are catego-
rized as follows: prevention costs, appraisal costs, internal failure costs, and external failure costs. These
quality costs are periodically listed on a quality cost report, which is used by management as it seeks to
ensure quality products and services and manage the costs of providing them.
LO7 Discuss the traditional and contemporary views of the optimal level of product quality. In
addition to observable quality costs, companies experience hidden quality costs, such as the opportunity
cost associated with lost market share. The contemporary perspective on product quality holds that if
both observable and hidden costs of product quality are considered, the optimal level of product qual-
ity occurs at the zero defect level. In contrast, the traditional viewpoint holds that the optimal level of
product quality occurs at the minimum point on the total quality cost curve, which typically is above the
zero-defect level.
LO8 Understand the different types of environmental costs and discuss environmental cost
management. Companies incur a variety of environmental costs. These costs include private versus
social environmental costs, and the private environmental costs include some visible and some hidden
costs. These visible and hidden environmental costs include the costs of monitoring, abatement, and
both on-site and off-site remediation.
Review Problem on Responsibility Accounting
James Madison National Bank has a division for each of the two counties in which it operates, Cayuga
and Oneida. Each divisional vice president is held accountable for both profit and invested capital.
Each division consists of two branch banks, East and West. Each branch manager is responsible for that
bank’s profit. The Cayuga Division’s East Branch has a Deposit Department, a Loan Department, and
an Administrative Services Department. The department supervisors of the Loan and Deposit Depart-
ments are accountable for departmental revenues; the Administrative Services Department supervisor is
accountable for costs.
All of James Madison National Bank’s advertising and promotion is done centrally. The adver-
tising and promotion cost pool for the year just ended, which amounted to $40,000, is allocated across
the four branch banks on the basis of budgeted branch revenue. Budgeted revenue for the year is
shown below.
Cayuga Division: West Branch ...................................................................................................... $400,000
East Branch ....................................................................................................... 200,000
Oneida Division: West Branch ...................................................................................................... 250,000
East Branch ....................................................................................................... 150,000
Required:
1. Draw an organization chart for James Madison National Bank that shows each subunit described
above, its manager’s title, and its designation as a responsibility center.
2. Distribute (allocate) the bank’s advertising cost pool to the four branch banks.

sion, however, not to lay off any highly skilled employees, such as inspectors and machinery operators.
Management was concerned that these highly skilled employees would easily find new jobs elsewhere
and not return when production returned to normal levels.
To occupy the skilled employees during the production cutback, they have been reassigned
temporarily to the Maintenance Department. Here they are performing general maintenance tasks,
such as repainting the interior of the factory, repairing the loading dock, and building wooden stor-
age racks for the warehouse. The skilled employees continued to receive their normal wages, which
average $22 per hour. However, the normal wages for Maintenance Department employees average
$12 per hour.
The supervisor of the Maintenance Department recently received the March performance report,
which indicated that his department’s labor cost exceeded the budget by $19,360. The department’s
actual labor cost was approximately 90 percent over the budget. The department supervisor complained
to the controller.

Participation; Behavioral
reduced underutilized building maintenance staffs, more and more cleaning services were subcontracted
Issues
to BSC. BSC also expanded into other building services such as painting and local moving.
(LO 1, 2, 3)
BSC maintains a pool of skilled workers who are contracted to perform the noncleaning services
because these services do not recur on a day-to-day basis for the individual buildings. Many of BSC’s full-
time employees have been with the firm for a number of years. Five zone managers are each responsible for
furnishing recurring nightly cleaning services to several businesses. In addition, the zone manager sells and
schedules noncleaning service jobs for the company’s central pool of skilled employees. Informal meet-
ings are held periodically to discuss BSC’s performance, personnel allocations, and scheduling problems.
BSC’s budgeting and planning have been done by the Forges, who also manage variations from budgets.
The Forges recently decided to retire and sold the business to Commercial Maintenance Inc. (CMI),
which provides similar services in a number of metropolitan locations that surround BSC’s business
area. After news of the sale, several of BSC’s long-term employees appeared resentful of the change in
ownership and did not know what to expect.

CMI’s senior management met with BSC’s managers and announced that George Fowler would
become president of BSC and that BSC would continue to operate as a separate subsidiary of CMI.
Furthermore, in accordance with CMI’s management philosophy, a responsibility-accounting system is
to be implemented at BSC. Also, in line with other CMI subsidiaries, a participatory budgeting process
is being considered. However, no decision will be made until an evaluation of BSC’s existing policies,
operational culture, and management is completed. In view of the significant change in management
philosophy, CMI has taken considerable time in explaining how each system operates and assuring
BSC’s managers that they are expected and encouraged to participate in both the planning and imple-
mentation of any of the systems that are to be adopted.
Required: Two new systems are being considered at Building Services Co.:
• Responsibility-accounting system
• Participatory budgeting system
For each of these systems:
1. Identify at least two behavioral advantages that could arise.
2. Identify at least two potential problems that could arise.
3. Discuss the likelihood that the system will contribute to the alignment of organizational and
personal goals.

costs in check by operating as efficiently as possible. Mathew Basler, the company’s president, has stated
that, to be successful, the company must provide a very high-quality product and meet its delivery com-

10 Manufacturing Plants 5 Sales Districts
There is currently a disagreement between the company’s two vice presidents regarding the
responsibility-accounting system. The vice president for manufacturing claims that the 10 plants should
be cost centers. He recently expressed the following sentiment: “The plants should be cost centers because
the plant managers do not control the sales of our products. Designating the plants as profit centers would
result in holding the plant managers responsible for something they can’t control.” A contrary view is
held by the vice president for marketing. He recently made the following remarks: “The plants should be
profit centers. The plant managers are in the best position to affect the company’s overall profit.”
Required: As the company’s new controller, you have been asked to make a recommendation to Mathew
Basler, the company president, regarding the responsibility center issue. Write a memo to the president mak-
ing a recommendation and explaining the reasoning behind it. In your memo, address the following points.
1. Assuming that Warriner Equipment Company’s overall goal is profitability, what are the compa-
ny’s critical success factors? A c ritical success factor is a variable that meets these two criteria: It
is largely under the company’s control and the company must succeed in this area in order to reach
its overall goal of profitability.

ger afford to ignore the importance of product quality. McDonough set up a task force that he headed to
implement a formal quality-improvement program. Included on the task force were representatives from
engineering, sales, customer service, production, and accounting, as McDonough believed this was a
companywide program and all employees should share the responsibility for its success.
After the first meeting of the task force, Sheila Hayes, manager of sales, asked Tony Reese, the pro-
duction manager, what he thought of the proposed program. Reese replied, “I have reservations. Quality
is too abstract to be attaching costs to it and then to be holding you and me responsible for cost improve-
ments. I like to work with goals that I can see and count! I don’t like my annual income to be based on a
decrease in quality costs; there are too many variables that we have no control over!”
Laser News Technology’s quality-improvement program has now been in operation for 18 months,
and the following quality cost report has recently been issued. As they were reviewing the report, Hayes
asked Reese what he thought of the quality program now. “The work is really moving through the Pro-
duction Department,” replied Reese. “We used to spend time helping the Customer Service Department
solve their problems, but they are leaving us alone these days. I have no complaints so far. I’ll be anxious
to see how much the program increases our bonuses.”

goals with the managers of the New Haven and Boston stores, who will receive bonuses if certain
performance measures are exceeded. The manager in Portland decided not to participate in the bonus
scheme. Since the district manager is unsure what type of bonus will encourage better performance,
the New Haven manager will receive a bonus based on sales in excess of budgeted sales of $570,000,
while the Boston manager will receive a bonus based on net income in excess of budgeted net income.
The company’s net income goal for each store is 12 percent of sales. The budgeted sales revenue for the
Boston store is $530,000.
Other pertinent data for May are as follows:
• Coastal District sales revenue was $1,500,000, and its cost of goods sold amounted to $633,750.
• The Coastal District spent $75,000 on advertising.
• General and administrative expenses for the Coastal District amounted to $180,000.
• At the New Haven store, sales were 40 percent of Coastal District sales, while sales at the Boston
store were 35 percent of district sales. The cost of goods sold in both New Haven and Boston was
42 percent of sales.
• Variable selling expenses (sales commissions) were 6 percent of sales for all stores, districts, and regions.
• Variable administrative expenses were 2.5 percent of sales for all stores, districts, and regions.
• Maintenance cost includes janitorial and repair services and is a direct cost for each store. The store
manager has complete control over this outlay. Maintenance costs were incurred as follows: New
Haven, $7,500; Boston, $600; and Portland, $4,500.
• Advertising is considered a direct cost for each store and is completely under the control of the
store manager. The New Haven store spent two-thirds of the Coastal District total outlay for adver-
tising, which was 10 times the amount spent in Boston on advertising.

• The rental expenses at the New Haven store were 40 percent of the Coastal District’s total, while
the Boston store incurred 30 percent of the district total.
• District expenses were allocated to the stores based on sales.
• New England Region general and administrative expenses of $165,000 were allocated to the
Coastal District. These expenses were, in turn, allocated equally to the district’s three stores.
Required:
1. Prepare the May segmented income statement for the Coastal District and for the New Haven and

2. Compute the Portland store’s net income for May.
3. Discuss the impact of the responsibility-accounting system and bonus structure on the managers’
behavior and the effect of their behavior on the financial results for the New Haven store and the

4. The assistant controller for the New England Region, Jack Isner, has been a close friend of the
New Haven store manager for over 20 years. When Isner saw the segmented income statement [as
prepared in requirement (1)], he realized that the New Haven store manager had really gone over-
board on advertising expenditures. To make his friend look better to the regional management, he
reclassified $25,000 of the advertising expenditures as miscellaneous expenses, and buried them in
rent and other costs. Comment on the ethical issues in the assistant controller’s actions. (Refer to
specific ethical standards for managerial accountants which were given in Chapter 1.)

Murphy had several discussions with the division managers for each product line and compiled the fol- x
lowing information from these meetings.

1. The division managers concluded that Murphy should allocate fixed manufacturing overhead to
both product lines and geographic areas on the basis of the ratio of the variable costs expended to
total variable costs.
2. Each of the division managers agreed that a reasonable basis for the allocation of depreciation on
plant and equipment would be the ratio of units produced per product line (or per geographical
area) to the total number of units produced.
3. There was little agreement on the allocation of administrative and selling expenses, so Murphy
decided to allocate only those expenses that were traceable directly to a segment. For example,
manufacturing staff salaries would be allocated to product lines, and sales staff salaries would be
allocated to geographic areas. Murphy used the following data for this allocation.

FOCUS COMPANY >>>
THIS CHAPTER’S FOCUS COMPANY is Suncoast Food Centers, a chain of
retail grocery stores in Florida. The company has three divisions. The Gulf and
Atlantic divisions operate individual grocery stores in six coastal Floridian cities. The Food
Processing Division operates dairy plants, bakeries, and meat-
processing facilities in Miami, Orlando, and
Jacksonville in order to supply the Suncoast
grocery stores with fresh food products. In
this chapter, we will explore how companies
evaluate the performance of investment cen-
ters, such as Suncoast’s three divisions. Invest-
ment centers are organizational subunits
whose managers have the authority to make signifi-
cant investment decisions, such as building a new store
or expanding an existing one.

Investment Centers and
Transfer Pricing
IN CONTRAST >>>
In contrast to the evaluation of investment center performance explored in
the first part of the chapter, we will turn our attention to transfer pricing. The
amount charged when one division of a company sells products or services to another
division is called a transfer price. We can continue to use Suncoast Food Centers for our
illustration, because the Suncoast food processing facilities sell their dairy, bakery, and
meat products to the Suncoast grocery stores at a transfer price. We will explore different
ways to set such transfer prices.

AFTER COMPLETING THIS CHAPTER, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
1 Explain the role of managerial accounting in achieving goal congruence.
2 Compute an investment center’s return on investment (ROI), residual income (RI),
and economic value added (EVA).
3 Explain how a manager can improve ROI by increasing either the sales margin or
capital turnover.
4 Describe some advantages and disadvantages of both ROI and residual income
as divisional performance measures.
5 Explain how to measure a division’s income and invested capital.
6 Use the general economic rule to set an optimal transfer price.
7 Explain how to base a transfer price on market prices, costs, or negotiations.
8 Understand the behavioral issues of incentives, goal congruence, and internal
controls.
How do the top managers of large companies such as Allstate Insurance Company and
G eneral Electric Company evaluate their divisions and other major subunits? The larg-
est subunits within these and similar organizations usually are designated as investment
centers. The manager of this type of r esponsibility center is held accountable not only for
the investment center’s profit but also for the capital invested to earn that profit. Invested
capital refers to assets, such as buildings and equipment, used in a subunit’s operations.
In this chapter, we will study the methods that managerial accountants use to evaluate
investment centers and the performance of their managers.1
In many organizations, one subunit manufactures a product or produces a service that
is then transferred to another subunit in the same organization. For example, automobile
parts manufactured in one division of G eneral Motors are then transferred to another G M
division that assembles vehicles.
The price at which products or services are transferred between two subunits in an
organization is called a t ransfer price. Since a transfer price affects the profit of both
the buying and selling divisions, the transfer price affects the performance evaluation of
these responsibility centers. Later in this chapter, we will study the methods that manage-
rial accountants use to determine transfer prices.

1 Recall from Chapter 12 that in practice the term p rofit center sometimes is used interchangeably with the term
investment center. To be precise, however, the term p rofit center should be reserved for a subunit whose manager is
held accountable for profit but not for invested capital.

quickly to events, and relieves top management of the need to direct the organization’s
day-to-day activities. The biggest challenge in making a decentralized organization
function effectively is to obtain goal congruence among the organization’s autonomous
managers.
Obtaining Goal Congruence: A Behavioral Challenge
Goal congruence is obtained when the managers of subunits throughout an organization
strive to achieve the goals set by top management. This desirable state of affairs is diffi-
cult to achieve for a variety of reasons. Managers often are unaware of the effects of their
decisions on the organization’s other subunits. Also, it is only human for people to be
more concerned with the performance of their own subunit than with the effectiveness of
the entire organization. The behavioral challenge in designing any management control
system is to come as close as possible to obtaining goal congruence.
To obtain goal congruence, the behavior of managers throughout an organization
must be directed toward top management’s goals. Successful managers not only have
their sights set on these organizational goals, but also have been given positive incentives
to achieve them. T he managerial accountant’s objective in designing a responsibility-
accounting system is to provide these incentives to the organization’s subunit manag-
ers. T he key factor in deciding how well the responsibility-accounting system works is
the extent to which it directs managers’ efforts toward organizational goals. Thus, the
accounting measures used to evaluate investment-center managers should provide them
with incentives to act in the interests of the overall organization.
Management by Objectives (MBO) An emphasis on obtaining goal congru-
ence is consistent with a broad managerial approach called management by objectives,
or M BO. Under the MBO philosophy, managers participate in setting goals that they
then strive to achieve. The goals usually are expressed in financial or other quantita-
tive terms, and the responsibility-accounting system is used to evaluate performance in
achieving them.
Adaptation of Management Control Systems
When an organization begins its operations, it is usually small and decision making
generally is centralized. The chief executive can control operations without a for-
mal responsibility-accounting system. It is relatively easy in a small organization for
managers to keep in touch with routine operations through face-to-face contact with
employees.
As an organization grows, however, its managers need more formal information
systems, including managerial accounting information, in order to maintain control.
Accounting systems are established to record events and provide the framework
for internal and external financial reports. Budgets become necessary to plan the
organization’s activity. As the organization gains experience in producing its goods
or services, cost standards and flexible budgets often are established to help con-
trol operations. As the organization continues to grow, some delegation of decision
making becomes necessary. Decentralization is often the result of this tendency
toward delegation. Ultimately, a fully developed responsibility-accounting system
emerges. Managerial accountants designate cost centers, revenue centers, profit
centers, and investment centers, and develop appropriate performance measures for
each subunit.
Thus, an organization’s accounting and managerial control systems usually adapt
and become more complex as the organization grows and changes.

550 Chapter 13 Investment Centers and Transfer Pricing
Measuring Performance in Investment Centers
In our study of investment-center performance evaluation, we will focus on Suncoast
Food Centers. This Florida chain of retail grocery stores has three divisions, as depicted
by the organization chart in Exhibit 13–1 .
The Gulf and Atlantic divisions consist of individual grocery stores located in six
coastal cities. The company’s Food Processing Division operates dairy plants, baker-
ies, and meat-processing plants in Miami, Orlando, and Jacksonville. These facilities
provide all Suncoast Food Centers with milk, ice cream, yogurt, cheese, breads and
desserts, and packaged meat. These Suncoast-brand food products are transferred to the
company’s Gulf and Atlantic divisions at transfer prices established by the corporate
controller’s office.
Suncoast Food Centers’ three divisions are investment centers. This responsibility-

Abbott Laboratories The primary goals of any profit-making enterprise include maximizing its profit-
ability and using its invested capital as effectively as possible. Managerial accountants
use three different measures to evaluate the performance of investment centers: return on
investment (ROI), residual income (RI), and economic value added (EVA® ). (EVA® is a
registered trademark of S tern Stewart & Co. ) We will illustrate each of these measures for
Suncoast Food Centers.

The most recent year’s ROI calculations for Suncoast Food Centers’ three divi-
sions are:

Atlantic Division .................................................................. _ $_6_,_7_5_0,_0_0_0_ ! 15%
$45,000,000
Notice how the ROI calculation for each division takes into account both divisional
income and the capital invested in the division. Why is this important? Suppose each
division were evaluated only on the basis of its divisional profit. The Atlantic Division
reported a higher divisional profit than the Gulf Division. Does this mean the Atlantic
Division performed better than the Gulf Division? The answer is no. Although the Atlan-
tic Division’s profit exceeded the Gulf Division’s profit, the Atlantic Division used a
much larger amount of invested capital to earn its profit. The Atlantic Division’s assets
are more than two times the assets of the Gulf Division.
Considering the relative size of the two divisions, we should expect the Atlantic
Division to earn a larger profit than the Gulf Division. The important question is not
how much profit each division earned, but rather how effectively each division used its
invested capital to earn a profit.

The Gulf Division’s sales margin is 5 percent ($3,000,000 of profit # $60,000,000

To bring about the improved sales margin, the Gulf Division manager would need
to increase divisional profit to $3,600,000 on sales of $60,000,000 ($3,600,000 #
$60,000,000 ! 6%). How could profit be increased without changing total sales rev-
enue? There are two possibilities: increase sales prices while selling less quantity, or
decrease expenses. Neither of these is necessarily easy to do. In increasing sales prices,
the division manager must be careful not to lose sales to the extent that total sales revenue
declines. Similarly, reducing the expenses must not diminish product quality, customer
service, or overall store atmosphere. Any of these changes could also result in lost sales
revenue.
An alternative way of increasing the Gulf Division’s ROI would be to increase its
capital turnover. Suppose the Gulf Division manager increased the division’s capital turn-
over to 4 while holding the sales margin constant at 5 percent. The division’s ROI would
climb from 15 percent to 20 percent:

Im pr ove d
improved ROI Sales margin capital turnover
! 5% " 4 ! 20%
To obtain the improved capital turnover, the Gulf Division manager would need
to either increase sales revenue or reduce the division’s invested capital. For example,
the improved ROI could be achieved by reducing invested capital to $15,000,000 while
maintaining sales revenue of $60,000,000. This would be a very tall order. The division
manager can lower invested capital somewhat by reducing inventories and can increase
sales revenue by using store space more effectively. But reducing inventories may lead to
stockouts and lost sales, and crowded aisles may drive customers away.
Improving ROI is a balancing act that requires all the skills of an effective man-
ager. The ROI analysis above merely shows the arena in which the balancing act is
performed.
Residual Income
Although ROI is the most popular investment-center performance measure, it has one

major drawback. To illustrate, suppose Suncoast’s Food Processing Division manager

Chapter 13 Investment Centers and Transfer Pricing 553
Now suppose it costs Suncoast Food Centers 12 cents for each dollar of capital to
invest in operational assets. What is the optimal decision for the Food Processing Divi-
sion manager to make, viewed from the perspective of the company as a whole? Since
it costs Suncoast Food Centers 12 percent for every dollar of capital, and the return on
investment in new equipment is 16 percent, the equipment should be purchased. For goal
congruence, the autonomous division manager should decide to buy the new equipment.
Now consider what is likely to happen. The Food Processing Division manager’s per-
formance is evaluated on the basis of his division’s ROI. Without the new equipment, the
divisional ROI is 20 percent ($3,600,000 of divisional profit # $18,000,000 of invested
capital). If he purchases the new equipment, his divisional ROI will decline:

$18,000,000 $18,000,000 $ $500,000
Why did this happen? Even though the investment in new equipment earns a return
of 16 percent, which is greater than the company’s cost of raising capital (12 percent),
the return is less than the division’s ROI without the equipment (20 percent). Averaging
the new investment with those already in place in the Food Processing Division merely
reduces the division’s ROI. Since the division manager is evaluated using ROI, he will be
reluctant to decide in favor of acquiring the new equipment.
The problem is that the ROI measure leaves out an important piece of information:
it ignores the firm’s cost of raising investment capital. For this reason, many managers
prefer to use a different investment-center performance measure instead of ROI.
Computing Residual Income An investment center’s r esidual income is defined
as follows:

where the imputed interest rate is the firm’s cost of acquiring investment capital.
Residual income is a dollar amount, not a ratio like ROI. It is the amount of an
investment center’s profit that remains (as a residual) after subtracting an imputed interest
charge. The term imputed means that the interest charge is estimated by the managerial
accountant. This charge reflects the firm’s minimum required rate of return on invested
capital. In some firms, the imputed interest rate depends on the riskiness of the invest-
ment for which the funds will be used. Thus, divisions that have different levels of risk
sometimes are assigned different imputed interest rates.
ROI and residual
income are common
performance measures
for investment centers.
Both measures relate
the profit earned from

to the capital required

The residual income of Suncoast’s Food Processing Division is computed below, both
with and without the investment in the new equipment. The imputed interest rate is 12 percent.

Notice that the Food Processing Division’s residual income will i ncrease if the new
equipment is purchased. What will be the division manager’s incentive if he is evaluated on
the basis of residual income instead of ROI? He will want to make the investment because
that decision will increase his division’s residual income. Thus, goal congruence is achieved
when the managerial accountant uses residual income to measure divisional performance.
Why does residual income facilitate goal congruence while ROI does not? Because

Unfortunately, residual income also has a serious drawback: It should not be used to
compare the performance of different-sized investment centers because it incorporates a
bias in favor of the larger investment center. To illustrate, the following table compares
the residual income of Suncoast Food Centers’ Gulf and Atlantic divisions. Notice that
the Atlantic Division’s residual income is considerably higher than the Gulf Division’s.
This is entirely due to the much greater size of the Atlantic Division, as evidenced by its
far greater invested capital.

Chapter 13 Investment Centers and Transfer Pricing 555
In short, neither ROI nor residual income provides a perfect measure of investment-
center performance. ROI can undermine goal congruence. Residual income distorts
comparisons between investment centers of different sizes. As a result, some companies
routinely use both measures for divisional performance evaluation.
Shareholder Value Analysis Some companies apply the residual income
concept to individual product lines. S hareholder value analysis calculates the
residual income for a major product line, with the objective of determining how the
product line affects the firm’s value to the shareholders. Suppose, for example, that
Suncoast Food Centers offers in-store, one-hour film development in selected stores.
Let’s say that the company’s investment in this service is $200,000 and the annual
profit is $40,000. Then the residual income on one-hour film development is $16,000
[$40,000 % ($200,000 " 12%)].
Economic Value Added
The most contemporary measure of investment center performance is economic value

£ ° ¢ §
Like residual income, the economic value added is a dollar amount. However, it differs
from residual income in two important ways. First, an investment center’s current liabili-
ties are subtracted from its total assets. Second, the weighted-average cost of capital is
used in the calculation.
Weighted-Average Cost of Capital Suncoast Food Centers has two sources
of long-term capital: debt and equity. The cost to Suncoast of issuing debt is the after-
tax cost of the interest payments on the debt, taking account of the fact that the inter-
est payments are tax deductible. The cost of Suncoast’s equity capital is the investment
opportunity rate of Suncoast Food Centers’ investors, that is, the rate they could earn on
investments of similar risk to that of investing in Suncoast Food Centers. The weighted-
average cost of capital (WACC) is defined as follows:

The interest rate on Suncoast Food Centers’ $40 million of debt is 9 percent, and
the company’s tax rate is 30 percent. Therefore, Suncoast’s after-tax cost of debt is
6.3 percent [9% " (1 % 30%)]. Let’s assume that the cost of Suncoast’s equity capital
is 12 percent. Moreover, the market value of the company’s equity is $60 million.2 The
following calculation shows that Suncoast Food Centers’WACC is 9.72 percent.
2 The b ook value of Suncoast Food Centers’ equity is $41 million, but that amount does not reflect the current value
of the company’s assets or the value of intangible assets such as the Suncoast Food Centers name.

The EVA analysis reveals that all three of Suncoast Food Centers’ divisions are con-
tributing substantially to the company’s economic value.
What does an EVA analysis tell us? EVA indicates how much shareholder wealth
is being created, as Roberto Goizueta, Coca-Cola ’s former CEO, explained: “We raise
capital to make concentrate and sell it at an operating profit. Then we pay the cost of that
capital. Shareholders pocket the difference (EVA amount).”3

Chapter 13 Investment Centers and Transfer Pricing 557
Measuring Income and Invested Capital
The ROI, residual-income, and economic value added (EVA) measures of investment-
center performance all use profit and invested capital in their formulas. This raises the
question of how to measure divisional profit and invested capital. This section will illus-
trate various approaches to resolving these measurement issues.
Invested Capital
We will focus on Suncoast Food Centers’ Food Processing Division to illustrate sev-
Learning Objective 5
eral alternative approaches to measuring an investment center’s capital. Exhibit 13–2
lists the assets and liabilities associated with the Food Processing Division. Notice that Explain how to measure a
Exhibit 13–2 does not constitute a complete balance sheet. First, there are no long- division’s income and invested
term liabilities, such as bonds payable, associated with the Food Processing Divi- capital.
sion. Although Suncoast Food Centers may have such long-term debt, it would not
be meaningful to assign portions of that debt to the company’s individual divisions.
Second, there is no stockholders’ equity associated with the Food Processing Division.
The owners of the company own stock in Suncoast Food Centers, not in its individual
divisions.
Average Balances ROI, residual income, and EVA are computed for a period
of time, such as a year or a month. Asset balances, on the other hand, are measured
at a point in time, such as December 31. Since divisional asset balances generally
will change over time, we use average balances in calculating ROI, residual income,
and EVA. For example, if the Food Processing Division’s balance in invested capital
was $19,000,000 on January 1 and $17,000,000 on December 31, we would use the
year’s average invested capital of $18,000,000 in the ROI, residual income, and EVA
calculations.
Should Total Assets Be Used? Exhibit 13–2 shows that the Food Process-
ing Division had average balances during the year of $2,000,000 in current assets,
$15,000,000 in long-lived assets, and $1,000,000 tied up in a plant under construction.
(Suncoast Food Centers is building a new high-tech dairy plant in Orlando to produce
its innovative zero-calorie ice cream.) In addition, Exhibit 13–2 discloses that the Food
Processing Division’s average balance of current liabilities was $1,000,000.

558 Chapter 13 Investment Centers and Transfer Pricing
What is the division’s invested capital? Several possibilities exist.
1. T otal assets. The management of Suncoast Food Centers has decided to use
average total assets for the year in measuring each division’s invested capital.
Thus, $18,000,000 is the amount used in the ROI, residual-income, and EVA
calculations discussed earlier in this chapter. This measure of invested capital
is appropriate if the division manager has considerable authority in making
decisions about a ll of the division’s assets, i ncluding nonproductive assets. In
this case, the Food Processing Division’s partially completed dairy plant is a
nonproductive asset. Since the division manager had considerable influence in
deciding to build the new plant and he is responsible for overseeing the project,
average total assets provides an appropriate measure.
2. T otal productive assets. In other companies, division managers are directed by top
management to keep nonproductive assets, such as vacant land or construction
in progress. In such cases, it is appropriate to exclude nonproductive assets from
the measure of invested capital. Then average total productive assets is used to
measure invested capital. If Suncoast Food Centers had chosen this alternative,
$17,000,000 would have been used in the ROI, residual-income, and EVA
calculations (total assets of $18,000,000 less $1,000,000 for the plant under
construction).
3. T otal assets less current liabilities. Some companies allow division manag-
ers to secure short-term bank loans and other short-term credit. In such cases,
invested capital often is measured by a verage total assets less average current
liabilities. This approach encourages investment-center managers to minimize
resources tied up in assets and maximize the use of short-term credit to finance
operations. If this approach had been used by Suncoast Food Centers, the Food
Processing Division’s invested capital would have been $17,000,000, total
assets of $18,000,000 less current liabilities of $1,000,000. (Note that current
liabilities are always subtracted from total assets for the measure of invested
capital used in the EVA measure.)
Gross or Net Book Value Another decision to make in choosing a measure of
invested capital is whether to use the g ross book value (acquisition cost) or the n et book
value of long-lived assets. (Net book value is the acquisition cost less accumulated depre-
ciation.) Suncoast Food Centers’ management has decided to use the average net book
value of $15,000,000 to value the Food Processing Division’s long-lived assets. If gross
book value had been used instead, the division’s measure of invested capital would have
been $22,000,000, as the following calculation shows.
Current assets ........................................................................................................................................... $ 2,000,000
Long-lived assets (at gross book value) ....................................................................................................... 19,000,000
Plant under construction ............................................................................................................................. 1,000,000
Total assets (at gross book value) ................................................................................................................ $22,000,000
There are advantages and disadvantages associated with both gross and net book
value as a measure of invested capital. The advantages of net book value are:
1. Using net book value maintains consistency with the balance sheet prepared for
external reporting purposes. This allows for more meaningful comparisons of
return-on-investment measures across different companies.
2. Using net book value to measure invested capital is also more consistent
with the definition of income, which is the numerator in ROI calculations. In
computing income, the current period’s depreciation on long-lived assets is
deducted as an expense.

†ROI rounded to nearest tenth of 1 percent.
The following two advantages are often associated with using gross book value:
1. The usual methods of computing depreciation, such as the straight-line and the
declining-balance methods, are arbitrary. Hence, they should not be allowed to
affect ROI, residual-income, or EVA calculations.
2. When long-lived assets are depreciated, their net book value declines over time. This
results in a misleading increase in ROI, residual income, and EVA across time.
Exhibit 13–3 provides an illustration of this phenomenon for the ROI calculated
on an equipment purchase under consideration by the Food Processing Division
manager. Notice that the ROI rises steadily across the five-year horizon if invested
capital is measured by net book value. However, using gross book value elimi-
nates this problem. If an accelerated depreciation method were used instead of the
straight-line method, the increasing trend in ROI would be even more pronounced.
A Behavioral Problem The tendency for net book value to produce a misleading
increase in ROI over time can have a serious effect on the incentives of investment-center
managers. Investment centers with old assets will show much higher ROIs than invest-
ment centers with relatively new assets. This can discourage investment-center managers
from investing in new equipment. If this behavioral tendency persists, a division’s assets
can become obsolete, making the division uncompetitive.
Allocating Assets to Investment Centers Some companies control cer-
tain assets centrally, although these assets are needed to carry on operations in the divi-
sions. Common examples are cash and accounts receivable. Divisions need cash in order
to operate, but many companies control cash balances centrally in order to minimize
their total cash holdings. Some large retail firms manage accounts receivable centrally.
A credit customer of some national department store chains can make a payment either
at the local store or by mailing the payment to corporate headquarters.
When certain assets are controlled centrally, some allocation basis generally is cho-
sen to allocate these asset balances to investment centers, for the purpose of measuring
invested capital. For example, cash may be allocated based on the budgeted cash needs in
each division or on the basis of divisional sales. Accounts receivable usually are allocated
on the basis of divisional sales. Divisions with less stringent credit terms are allocated
proportionately larger balances of accounts receivable.

560 Chapter 13 Investment Centers and Transfer Pricing
Measuring Investment-Center Income
In addition to choosing a measure of investment-center capital, an accountant must
Learning Objective 5
also decide how to measure a center’s income. The key issue is controllability; the
Explain how to measure a choice involves the extent to which uncontrollable items are allowed to influence the
division’s income and invested income measure. The Excel spreadsheet in Exhibit 13–4 illustrates several different
capital. possibilities for measuring the income of Suncoast Food Centers’ Food Processing
Division.
Suncoast Food Centers’ top management uses the p rofit margin controllable by
division manager, $3,600,000, to evaluate the Food Processing Division manager. This
profit measure is used in calculating ROI, residual income, or EVA. Some fixed costs
traceable to the division have not been deducted from this $3,600,000 amount, but the
division manager cannot control or significantly influence these costs. Hence they are
excluded from the ROI calculation in evaluating the division manager. In calculating EVA,
the $3,600,000 profit-margin amount is converted to an after-tax basis by multiplying it by
1 minus the tax rate of 30 percent.
Pay for Performance Some companies reward investment-center managers with
cash bonuses if they meet a predetermined target on a specified performance criterion,
such as residual income, ROI, or EVA. Such payments often are referred to as pay for
performance, m erit pay, or i ncentive compensation. These cash bonuses generally are
single payments, independent of a manager’s base salary.
As the result of public outrage over the recent nearly catastrophic financial melt-
down, as well as other perceived corporate excesses, many companies are beginning to
rein in top management compensation packages. The U.S. government also reacted to
the negative public mood by appointing a “pay czar” whose job it was to oversee top
management compensation for the various companies that received “bailout” funds from
government coffers during the recent financial crisis.4

Chapter 13 Investment Centers and Transfer Pricing 561
Managers versus Investment Centers It is important to make a distinction
between an investment center and its manager. In evaluating the m anager’s performance,
only revenues and costs that the manager can control or significantly influence should be
included in the profit measure. Remember that the overall objective of the performance
measure is to provide incentives for goal-congruent behavior. No performance measure
can motivate a manager to make decisions about costs he or she cannot control. This
explains why Suncoast Food Centers’ top management relies on the profit margin con-
trollable by division manager to compute the manager’s ROI performance measure.
Evaluating the Food Processing Division as a viable economic investment is a differ-
ent matter altogether. In this evaluation, traceability of costs, rather than controllability,
is the issue. For this purpose, Suncoast Food Centers’ top management uses the profit
margin traceable to division to compute the divisional ROI, residual income, or EVA. As
Exhibit 13–4 shows, this amount is $2,400,000.
Other Profit Measures The other measures of divisional profit shown in Exhibit
13–4 (lines 4, 5, and 6) also are used by some companies. The rationale behind these divi-
sional income measures is that all corporate costs have to be covered by the operations
of the divisions. Allocating corporate costs, interest, and income taxes to the divisions
makes division managers aware of these costs.
Inflation: Historical-Cost versus Current-Value Accounting
Whether measuring investment-center income or invested capital, the impact of price-
level changes should not be forgotten. During periods of inflation, historical-cost
asset values soon cease to reflect the cost of replacing those assets. Therefore, some
accountants argue that investment-center performance measures based on historical-
cost accounting are misleading. Yet surveys of corporate managers indicate that an
accounting system based on current values would not alter their decisions. Most man-
agers believe that measures based on historical-cost accounting are adequate when
used in conjunction with budgets and performance targets. As managers prepare
those budgets, they build their expectations about inflation into the budgets and per-
formance targets.
Another reason for using historical-cost accounting for internal purposes is that it
is required for external reporting. Thus, historical-cost data already are available, while
installing current-value accounting would add substantial incremental costs to the organi-
zation’s information system.
Other Issues in Segment Performance Evaluation
Alternatives to ROI, Residual Income, and Economic
Value Added (EVA)
ROI, residual income, and EVA are short-run performance measures. They focus on only
one period of time. Yet an investment center is really a collection of assets (investments),
each of which has a multiperiod life. Exhibit 13–5 portrays this perspective of an invest-
ment center.
To evaluate any one of these individual investments correctly requires a multiperiod
viewpoint, which takes into account the timing of the cash flows from the investment.
For example, investment E in Exhibit 13–5 may start out slowly in years 4 and 5, but it
may be economically justified by its expected high performance in years 8, 9, and 10.
Any evaluation of the investment center in year 5 that ignores the long-term performance
of its various investments can result in a misleading conclusion. Thus, single-period

performance measures suffer from myopia. They focus on only a short time segment that
slices across the division’s investments as portrayed in E xhibit 13–5.
To avoid this short-term focus, some organizations downplay ROI, residual income,
and EVA in favor of an alternative approach. Instead of relating profit to invested capital
in a single measure, these characteristics of investment-center performance are evaluated
separately. Actual divisional profit for a time period is compared to a flexible budget, and
variances are used to analyze performance. The division’s major investments are evalu-
ated through a postaudit of the investment decisions. For example, investment E may
have been undertaken because of expected high performance in years 8, 9, and 10. When
that time comes, a review will determine whether the project lived up to expectations.
Evaluating periodic profit through flexible budgeting and variance analysis, coupled
with postaudits of major investment decisions, is a more complicated approach to evalu-
ating investment centers. However, it does help management avoid the myopia of single-
period measures such as ROI, residual income, and EVA.
Importance of Nonfinancial Information
Although financial measures such as segment profit, ROI, residual income, and EVA are
widely used in performance evaluation, nonfinancial measures are important also. Manu-
facturers collect data on rates of defective products, airlines record information on lost
bags and aircraft delays, and hotels keep track of occupancy rates. The proper evalua-
tion of an organization and its segments requires that multiple performance measures be
defined and used. The b alanced scorecard, with its l ead and l ag measures of performance,
is one tool that is more and more widely used as a means of introducing nonfinancial
measures into performance evaluation. See Chapter 10 for a discussion of the balanced
scorecard.
Measuring Performance in Nonprofit Organizations
Management control in a nonprofit organization presents a special challenge. Such orga-
nizations often are managed by professionals, such as physicians in a hospital. Moreover,
many people participate in a nonprofit organization at some personal sacrifice, motivated
by humanitarian or public service ideals. Often, such people are less receptive to formal
control procedures than their counterparts in business.
The goals of nonprofit organizations often are less clear-cut than those of busi-
nesses. Public service objectives may be difficult to specify with precision and even

Chapter 13 Investment Centers and Transfer Pricing 563
more difficult to measure in terms of achievement. For example, one community health
center was established in an economically depressed area with three stated goals:
1. To reduce costs in a nearby hospital by providing a clinic for people to use
instead of the hospital emergency room.
2. To provide preventive as well as therapeutic care, and establish outreach pro-
grams in the community.
3. To become financially self-sufficient.
There is some conflict between these objectives, since goal 2 does not provide rev-
enue to the center, while goals 1 and 3 focus on financial efficiency. Moreover, the health
center was staffed with physicians who could have achieved much greater incomes in
private practice. The management control tools described in this and the preceding three
chapters can be used in nonprofit organizations. However, the challenges in doing so
effectively often are greater.
Transfer Pricing
Measuring performance in profit centers or investment centers is made more complicated
by transfers of goods or services between responsibility centers. The amount charged
when one division sells goods or services to another division is called a transfer price.
This price affects the profit measurement for both the selling division and the buying
division. A high transfer price results in high profit for the selling division and low profit
for the buying division. A low transfer price has the opposite effect. Consequently, the
transfer-pricing policy c an affect the i ncentives of autonomous division managers as they
decide whether to make the transfer. Exhibit 13–6 depicts this scenario.
Goal Congruence
What should be management’s goal in setting transfer prices for internally transferred
goods or services? In a decentralized organization, the managers of profit centers and
investment centers often have considerable autonomy in deciding whether to accept or
reject orders and whether to buy inputs from inside the organization or from outside. For
example, a large manufacturer of farm equipment allows its Assembly Division managers
to buy parts either from another division of the company or from independent manufac-
turers. The goal in setting transfer prices is to establish incentives for autonomous divi-
sion managers to make decisions that support the overall goals of the organization.
Suppose it is in the best interests of Suncoast Food Centers for the baked goods pro-
duced by the Food Processing Division’s Orlando Bakery to be transferred to the Gulf
Division’s stores in the Tampa Bay area. Thus, if the firm were centralized, bakery prod-
ucts would be transferred from the Food Processing Division to the Gulf Division. How-
ever, Suncoast Food Centers is a decentralized company, and the Gulf Division manager
is free to buy baked goods either from the Food Processing Division or from an outside
bakery company. Similarly, the Food Processing Division manager is free to accept or
reject an order for baked goods, at any

The general rule specifies the transfer price as the sum of two cost components. The
first component is the outlay cost incurred by the division that produces the goods or
services to be transferred. Outlay costs will include the direct variable costs of the
product or service and any other outlay costs that are incurred only as a result of the
transfer. The second component in the general transfer-pricing rule is the opportunity
cost incurred by the organization as a whole because of the transfer. Recall from Chap-

Chapter 13 Investment Centers and Transfer Pricing 565
In applying the general transfer-pricing rule, we will distinguish between two different
scenarios.
Scenario I: No Excess Capacity Suppose the Food Processing Division can
sell all the bread it can produce to outside buyers at a market price of $11 per rack. Since
the division can sell all of its production, it has n o excess capacity. Excess capacity exists
only when more goods can be produced than the producer is able to sell, due to low
demand for the product.
What transfer price does the general rule yield under this scenario of no excess
capacity? The transfer price is determined as follows:
Outlay cost:
Standard variable cost of production ................................................................................................. $ 7.00 per rack
Standard variable cost of transportation ............................................................................................ .25 per rack
Total outlay cost ............................................................................................................................... $ 7.25 per rack
Opportunity cost:
Selling price per unit in external market ............................................................................................. $11.00 per rack
Less: Variable cost of production and transportation ........................................................................... 7.25 per rack
Opportunity cost (forgone contribution margin) ................................................................................... $ 3.75 per rack
General transfer-pricing rule:
Transfer price ! Outlay cost $ Opportunity cost
$11.00 ! $7.25 $ $3.75
The outlay cost incurred by the Food Processing Division in order to transfer a rack
of bread includes the standard variable production cost of $7.00 and the standard variable
transportation cost of $.25. The o pportunity cost incurred by Suncoast Food Centers when
its Food Processing Division transfers a rack of bread to the Gulf Division instead of sell-
ing it in the external market is the forgone contribution margin from the lost sale, equal to
$3.75. Why does the company lose a sale in the external market for every rack of bread
transferred to the Gulf Division? The sale is lost because there is n o excess capacity in the
Food Processing Division. Every rack of bread transferred to another company division
results in one less rack of bread sold in the external market.
Goal Congruence How does the general transfer-pricing rule promote goal con-
gruence? Suppose the Gulf Division’s grocery stores can sell a loaf of bread for $1.50, or
$18 for a rack of 12 loaves ($18 ! 12 " $1.50). What is the best way for Suncoast Food
Centers to use the limited production capacity in the Food Processing Division’s Orlando
bakery? The answer is determined as follows:
Contribution to Suncoast Food Centers Contribution to Suncoast Food Centers
from Sale in External Market from Transfer to Gulf Division
Wholesale selling price per rack .......................... $11.00 Retail selling price per rack ............................ $18.00
Less: Variable costs ............................................ 7.25 Less: Variable costs ....................................... 7.25
Contribution margin ........................................... $ 3.75 Contribution margin ...................................... $10.75
The best use of the bakery’s limited production capacity is to produce bread for transfer to
the Gulf Division. If the transfer price is set at $11.00, as the general rule specifies, goal
congruence is maintained. The Food Processing Division manager is willing to transfer
bread to the Gulf Division, because the transfer price of $11.00 is equal to the external
market price. The Gulf Division manager is willing to buy the bread, because her division
will have a contribution margin of $7.00 on each rack of bread transferred ($18.00 sales
price minus the $11.00 transfer price).

566 Chapter 13 Investment Centers and Transfer Pricing
Now consider a different situation. Suppose a local organization makes a special
offer to the Gulf Division manager to buy several hundred loaves of bread to sell in a pro-
motional campaign. The organization offers to pay $.80 per loaf, which is $9.60 per rack
of a dozen loaves. What will the Gulf Division manager do? She must pay a transfer price
of $11.00 per rack, so the Gulf Division would lose $1.40 per rack if the special offer
were accepted ($1.40 ! $11.00 % $9.60). The Gulf Division manager will decline the
special offer. Is this decision in the best interests of Suncoast Food Centers as a whole? If
the offer were accepted, the company as a whole would make a positive contribution of
$2.35 per rack, as shown below.
Contribution to Suncoast Food Centers If Special Offer Is Accepted
Special price per rack ............................................................................................................................ $9.60 per rack
Less: Variable cost to company .............................................................................................................. 7.25 per rack
Contribution to company, per rack .......................................................................................................... $2.35 per rack
However, the company can make even more if its Food Processing Division sells bread
directly in its external market. Then the contribution to the company is $3.75, as we have
just seen. (The external market price of $11.00 per rack minus a variable cost of $7.25
per rack equals $3.75 per rack.) Thus, Suncoast Food Centers is better off, as a whole, if
the Gulf Division’s special offer is rejected. Once again, the general transfer-pricing rule
results in goal-congruent decision making.
Scenario II: Excess Capacity Now let’s change our basic assumption, and sup-
pose the Food Processing Division’s Orlando bakery has excess production capacity.
This means that the total demand for its bread from all sources, including the Gulf and
Atlantic divisions and the external market, is less than the bakery’s production capacity.
Under this scenario of excess capacity, what does the general rule specify for a transfer
price?
Transfer price ! Outlay cost $ Opportunity cost
$7.25 ! $7.25 $ 0
The o utlay cost in the Food Processing Division’s Orlando bakery is still $7.25, since
“It is difficult for people it does not depend on whether there is idle capacity or not. The opportunity cost, how-
‘doing the business’ to stop ever, is now zero. There is no opportunity cost to the company when a rack of bread is
and consult about the transferred to the Gulf Division, because the Food Processing Division can still satisfy all
transfer pricing implications of its external demand for bread. Thus, the general rule specifies a transfer price of $7.25,
of their moves, but they the total standard variable cost of production and transportation.
have to.” (13d)
Respondent, Ernst &
Young Survey Goal Congruence Let’s reconsider what will happen when the Gulf Division man-
ager receives the local organization’s special offer to buy bread at $9.60 per rack. The
Gulf Division will now show a positive contribution of $2.35 per rack on the special order.
Special price per rack ................................................................................................................................ $9.60 per rack
Less: Transfer price paid by Gulf Division .................................................................................................... 7.25 per rack
Contribution to Gulf Division ....................................................................................................................... $2.35 per rack
The Gulf Division manager will accept the special offer. This decision is also in
the best interests of Suncoast Food Centers. The company, as a whole, also will make a
contribution of $2.35 per rack on every rack transferred to the Gulf Division to satisfy
the special order. Once again, the general transfer-pricing rule maintains goal-congruent
decision-making behavior.

Chapter 13 Investment Centers and Transfer Pricing 567
Notice that the general rule yields a transfer price that leaves the Food Processing
Division manager indifferent as to whether the transfer will be made. At a transfer price
of $7.25, the contribution to the Food Processing Division will be zero (transfer price of
$7.25 less variable cost of $7.25). To avoid this problem, we can view the general rule
as providing a lower bound on the transfer price. Some companies allow the producing
division to add a markup to this lower bound in order to provide a positive contribution
margin. This in turn provides a positive incentive to make the transfer.
Difficulty in Implementing the General Rule The general transfer-pricing
rule will always promote goal-congruent decision making i f the rule can be implemented.
However, the rule is often difficult or impossible to implement due to the difficulty of
measuring opportunity costs. Such a cost-measurement problem can arise for a num-
ber of reasons. One reason is that the external market may not be perfectly competitive.
Under p erfect competition, the market price does not depend on the quantity sold by
any one producer. Under i mperfect competition, a single producer or group of produc-
ers can affect the market price by varying the amount of product available in the market.
In such cases, the external market price depends on the production decisions of the pro-
ducer. This in turn means that the opportunity cost incurred by the company as a result of
internal transfers depends on the quantity sold externally. These interactions may make it
impossible to measure accurately the opportunity cost caused by a product transfer.
Other reasons for difficulty in measuring the opportunity cost associated with a prod-
uct transfer include uniqueness of the transferred goods or services, a need for the pro-
ducing division to invest in special equipment in order to produce the transferred goods,
and interdependencies among several transferred products or services. For example, the
producing division may provide design services as well as production of the goods for
a buying division. What is the opportunity cost associated with each of these related
outputs of the producing division? In many such cases, it is difficult to sort out the oppor-
tunity costs.
The general transfer-pricing rule provides a good conceptual model for the mana-
gerial accountant to use in setting transfer prices. Moreover, in many cases, it can be
implemented. When the general rule cannot be implemented, organizations turn to other
transfer-pricing methods, as we shall see next.
Transfers Based on the External Market Price
A common approach is to set the transfer price equal to the price in the external market.
Learning Objective 7
In the Suncoast Food Centers illustration, the Food Processing Division would set the
transfer price for bread at $11.00 per rack, since that is the price the division can obtain Explain how to base a transfer
in its external market. When the producing division has no excess capacity and perfect price on market prices, costs,

transfer-pricing rule and the external market price yield the same transfer price. This fact
is illustrated for Suncoast Food Centers as follows:
Transfer price ! Outlay cost $ Opportunity cost

! product i on and $ margin of a n external
transportation sale
! $7.25 $ ($11.00 % $7.25) ! $11.00
Transfer price ! External market price ! $11.00
If the producing division has excess capacity or the external market is imperfectly
competitive, the general rule and the external market price will not yield the same trans-
fer price.

PAGE 603
================================================================================

568 Chapter 13 Investment Centers and Transfer Pricing
If the transfer price is set at the market price, the producing division should have the
option of either producing goods for internal transfer or selling in the external market.
The buying division should be required to purchase goods from inside its organization
if the producing division’s goods meet the product specifications. Otherwise, the buying
division should have the autonomy to buy from a supplier outside its own organization.
To handle pricing disputes that may arise, an arbitration process should be established.
Transfer prices based on market prices are consistent with the responsibility-accounting
concepts of profit centers and investment centers. In addition to encouraging division
managers to focus on divisional profitability, market-based transfer prices help to show
the contribution of each division to overall company profit. Suppose the Food Processing
Division of Suncoast Food Centers transfers bread to the Gulf Division at a market-based
transfer price of $11.00 per rack. The following contribution margins will be earned by
the two divisions and the company as a whole.
Food Processing Division Gulf Division
Transfer price ...................................... $11.00 per rack Retail sales price ........................... $18.00 per rack
Less: Variable costs .............................. 7.25 per rack Less: Transfer price ....................... 11.00 per rack
Contribution margin ............................. $ 3.75 per rack Contribution margin ...................... $ 7.00 per rack
Suncoast Food Centers
Retail sales price ............................................................................................................................... $18.00 per rack
Less: Variable costs ........................................................................................................................... 7.25 per rack
Contribution margin .......................................................................................................................... $10.75 per rack
When aggregate divisional profits are determined for the year, and ROI and residual
income are computed, the use of a market-based transfer price helps to assess the contri-
butions of each division to overall corporate profits.
Distress Market Prices Occasionally an industry will experience a period of sig-
nificant excess capacity and extremely low prices. For example, when gasoline prices
soared due to a foreign oil embargo, the market prices for recreational vehicles and power
boats fell temporarily to very low levels.
Under such extreme conditions, basing transfer prices on market prices can lead to
decisions that are not in the best interests of the overall company. Basing transfer prices
on artificially l ow distress market prices could lead the producing division to sell or close
the productive resources devoted to producing the product for transfer. Under distress
market prices, the producing division manager might prefer to move the division into a
more profitable product line. While such a decision might improve the division’s profit
in the short run, it could be contrary to the best interests of the company overall. It might
be better for the company as a whole to avoid divesting itself of any productive resources
and to ride out the period of market distress. To encourage an autonomous division man-
ager to act in this fashion, some companies set the transfer price equal to the long-run
average external market price, rather than the current (possibly depressed) market price.
Negotiated Transfer Prices
Many companies use negotiated transfer prices. Division managers or their representatives
actually negotiate the price at which transfers will be made. Sometimes they start with the
external market price and then make adjustments for various reasons. For example, the
producing division may enjoy some cost savings on internal transfers that are not obtained
on external sales. Commissions may not have to be paid to sales personnel on internally
transferred products. In such cases, a negotiated transfer price may split the cost savings
between the producing and buying divisions.
In other instances, a negotiated transfer price may be used because no external mar-
ket exists for the transferred product.

================================================================================
PAGE 604
================================================================================

Chapter 13 Investment Centers and Transfer Pricing 569
Two drawbacks sometimes characterize negotiated transfer prices. First, negotia-
tions can lead to divisiveness and competition between participating division managers.
This can undermine the spirit of cooperation and unity that is desirable throughout an
organization. Second, although negotiating skill is a valuable managerial talent, it should
not be the sole or dominant factor in evaluating a division manager. If, for example, the
producing division’s manager is a better negotiator than the buying division’s manager,
then the producing division’s profit may look better than it should, simply because of its
manager’s superior negotiating ability.
Cost-Based Transfer Prices
Organizations that do not base prices on market prices or negotiations often turn to a cost-
based transfer-pricing approach.
Variable Cost One approach is to set the transfer price equal to the standard vari-
able cost. The problem with this approach is that even when the producing division has
excess capacity, it is not allowed to show any contribution margin on the transferred prod-
ucts or services. To illustrate, suppose the Food Processing Division has excess capacity
and the transfer price is set at the standard variable cost of $7.25 per rack of bread. There
is no positive incentive for the division to produce and transfer bread to the Gulf Division.
The Food Processing Division’s contribution margin from a transfer will be zero (transfer
price of $7.25 minus variable costs of $7.25 equals zero). Some companies avoid this
problem by setting the transfer price at standard variable cost plus a markup to allow the
producing division a positive contribution margin.
Full Cost An alternative is to set the transfer price equal to the f ull cost of the trans-
ferred product or service. F ull (or a bsorption ) c ost is equal to the product’s variable cost
plus an allocated portion of fixed overhead.
Suppose the Food Processing Division’s Orlando bakery has budgeted annual fixed
overhead of $500,000 and budgeted annual production of 200,000 racks of bread. The
full cost of the bakery’s product is computed as follows:
Full cost ! Variable cost $ Allocated fixed overhead
$500,000 budgeted fixed overhead
! $7.25 per rack $_ _________ _ _________ ________ _
200,000 budgeted racks of bread
! $7.25 $ $2.50
! $9.75 per rack
Under this approach, the transfer price is set at $9.75 per rack of bread.
Dysfunctional Decision-Making Behavior Basing transfer prices on full
cost entails a serious risk of causing dysfunctional decision-making behavior. Full-
cost-based transfer prices lead the buying division to view costs that are fixed for the
company as a whole as variable costs to the buying division. This can cause faulty deci-
sion making.
To illustrate, suppose the Food Processing Division has excess capacity, and the
transfer price of bread is equal to the full cost of $9.75 per rack. What will happen if the
Gulf Division receives the special offer discussed previously, where it can sell bread to a
local organization at a special price of $9.60 per rack? The Gulf Division manager will
reject the special order, since otherwise her division would incur a loss of $.15 per rack.
Special price per rack ................................................................................................................................ $9.60 per rack
Less: Transfer price based on full cost ........................................................................................................ 9.75 per rack

What is in the best interests of the company as a whole? Suncoast Food Centers would
make a positive contribution of $2.35 per rack on the bread sold in the special order.
Special price per rack ................................................................................................................................ $9.60 per rack
Less: Variable cost in Food Processing Division ........................................................................................... 7.25 per rack
Contribution to company as a whole ............................................................................................................ $2.35 per rack
What has happened here? Setting the transfer price equal to the full cost of $9.75 has
turned a cost that is fixed in the Food Processing Division, and hence is fixed for the
company as a whole, into a variable cost from the viewpoint of the Gulf Division man-
ager. The manager would tend to reject the special offer, even though accepting it would
benefit the company as a whole.
Although the practice is common, transfer prices should not be based on full cost.
The risk is too great that the cost behavior in the producing division will be obscured.
This can all too easily result in poor decisions in the buying division.
Standard versus Actual Costs
Throughout our discussion of transfer prices, we have used standard costs rather than
actual costs. This was true in our discussion of the general transfer-pricing rule as well
as for cost-based transfer prices. Transfer prices should not be based on actual costs,
because such a practice would allow an inefficient producing division to pass its excess
production costs on to the buying division in the transfer price. When standard costs are
used in transfer-pricing formulas, the buying division is not forced to pick up the tab for
the producer’s inefficiency. Moreover, the producing division is given an incentive to
control its costs, since any costs of inefficiency cannot be passed on.
Undermining Divisional Autonomy
Suppose the manager of Suncoast Food Centers’ Food Processing Division has excess
capacity but insists on a transfer price of $9.75, based on full cost. The Gulf Division
manager is faced with the special offer for bread at $9.60 per rack. She regrets that she
will have to decline the offer because it would cause her division’s profit to decline, even
though the company’s interests would be best served by accepting the special order. The
Gulf Division manager calls the company president and explains the situation. She asks
the president to intervene and force the Food Processing Division manager to lower his

Ernst & Young There is no obvious answer to this dilemma. In practice, central managers are reluctant
to intervene in such disputes unless the negative financial consequences to the organization
are quite large. Most managers believe the benefits of decentralized decision making are
important to protect, even if it means an occasional dysfunctional decision.
An International Perspective
Two international issues arise in the case of multinational firms setting transfer prices
between divisions in different countries.
Income-Tax Rates Multinational companies often consider domestic and foreign
income-tax rates when setting transfer prices. For example, suppose a company based in

the complexity of the tax issues involved. According to a survey by Ernst & Young LLP,
Ernst & Young, IRS
“transfer pricing is the top tax issue facing multinational corporations. Of the international
tax directors at 582 multinational organizations polled in the survey, 75 percent expect
their company to face a transfer-pricing audit within the next two years. Respondents
cited related-party transactions (including the intercompany transfer of goods, services,
properties, loans, and leases) involving administrative and management services as the
most likely to be audited. Moreover, there has been an increase in transfer pricing audit
activity in recent years. 5
“The Internal Revenue Service (I RS ) is concerned that companies could use transfer
prices to shift profits between related entities through cost of goods sold. Thus, transfer
pricing manipulation could be used by taxpayers to shift income from high tax jurisdic-
tions like the U.S. to low tax jurisdictions. The right price from the IRS’s perspective is
the market value price. Because it’s difficult to prove that the transfer price was equal
to the market price, companies often find themselves in disputes with the IRS. But now
there’s help. The IRS’s Advanced Pricing Agreement Program provides companies an
opportunity to avoid costly audits and litigation by allowing them to negotiate a pro-
spective agreement with the IRS regarding the facts, the transfer pricing methodology,
and an acceptable range of results. The program is aimed at multinational corporations
interested in avoiding penalties, managing risk, and determining their tax liability with
certainty.” 6
Europe also has a division in Asia. A European division produces a subassembly, which
is transferred to the Asian division for assembly and sale of the final product. Suppose
also that the income-tax rate for the company’s European division is higher than the rate
in the Asian division’s country. How would these different tax rates affect the transfer
price for the subassembly?
The company’s management has an incentive to set a low transfer price for the sub-
assembly. This will result in relatively low profits for the company’s European division “Transfer pricing has
and a relatively high income for the Asian division. Since the tax rate is lower in the become the most difficult
Asian country, the overall company will save on income tax. By setting a low transfer area of international
price, the company will shift a portion of its income to a country with a lower tax rate. taxation.” (13f)
Tax laws vary among countries with regard to flexibility in setting transfer prices. Some Ernst & Young
countries’ tax laws prohibit the behavior described in our example, while other coun-
tries’ laws permit it. 56
Import Duties Another international issue that can affect a firm’s transfer pricing
policy is the imposition of import duties, or tariffs. These are fees charged to an importer,
generally on the basis of the reported value of the goods being imported. Consider again
the example of a firm with divisions in Europe and Asia. If the Asian country imposes
an import duty on goods transferred in from the European division, the company has an
incentive to set a relatively low transfer price on the transferred goods. This will minimize

the duty to be paid and maximize the overall profit for the company as a whole. As in the
case of taxation, countries sometimes pass laws to limit a multinational firm’s flexibility
in setting transfer prices for the purpose of minimizing import duties.

manager, because the measures also are affected by factors beyond the manager’s control.
For example, the income of an orange-growing division of an agricultural company will
be affected not only by the manager’s diligence and ability, but also by the weather and
insect infestations.
Since most people exhibit r isk aversion, managers must be compensated for the risk
they must bear. This compensation comes in the form of higher salaries or bonuses. Thus,
the design of a managerial performance evaluation and reward system involves a trade-

Achieving the optimal trade-off between risk and incentives is a delicate balancing act
that requires the skill and experience of top management.
Goal Congruence and Internal Control Systems
Although most business professionals have high ethical standards, there are unfortunately
those who will cut corners. An internal control system is designed to provide reason-
able assurance of the achievement of objectives in: (1) the effectiveness and efficiency of
operations; (2) reliability of financial reporting; and (3) compliance with laws and regula-
tions. Internal control procedures are designed to prevent the major lapses in responsible
behavior described below.
Fraud Theft or misuse of an organization’s resources constitutes f raud. To prevent
and detect fraud, organizations establish well-defined procedures that prescribe how
valuable resources will be handled. For example, many organizations require all checks
above a particular amount to be authorized by two people.
Financial Misrepresentation Internal control systems also are designed to
prevent managers from intentionally (or accidentally) misstating an organization’s
financial records. Most companies have an i nternal audit staff, which reviews finan-
cial records throughout the organization to ensure their accuracy. (Appendix I on
pages 766–771 explores the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and internal controls over financial
reporting.) 7
Corruption Activities such as bribery, deceit, illegal political campaign contribu-
tions, and kickbacks constitute corruption. Most organizations have internal control pro-
cedures and codes of conduct to prevent and detect corrupt practices. For example, many
organizations forbid their purchasing personnel from accepting gifts or gratuities from
the sales personnel with whom they conduct business. The Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1977, prohibits a variety of corrupt practices in
foreign business operations. For example, the law prohibits a company’s management
from bribing officials of a foreign government in return for favorable treatment of their
company.
Unauthorized Action Sometimes a well-meaning employee is tempted to take an
action that is not illegal or even unethical, but it is contrary to the organization’s policies.
Internal control procedures also are designed to detect and prevent unauthorized actions
by an organization’s employees, when those actions could reflect unfavorably on the
organization. For example, a company may prohibit its employees from using company
facilities for a rally in support of a controversial social cause.
An internal control system constitutes an integral part of an organization’s efforts to
achieve its goals. To be effective, internal control procedures require top management’s
full support and intolerance of intentional violations.
7 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 2002, is designed to ensure that a company’s financial
statements accurately portray its financial condition.

574 Chapter 13 Investment Centers and Transfer Pricing
Chapter Summary
LO1 Explain the role of managerial accounting in achieving goal congruence. An important
objective of any organization’s managerial accounting system is to promote goal congruence among
its employees. Thus, the primary criterion for judging the effectiveness of performance measures for
responsibility-center managers is the extent to which the measures promote goal congruence.
LO2 Compute an investment center’s return on investment (ROI), residual income (RI), and eco-
nomic value added (EVA). An investment center’s ROI is equal to its income divided by its invested
capital. The investment center’s RI is equal to its profit minus the product of its invested capital and
an imputed interest rate. The investment center’s EVA is computed as follows: After-tax operating
income % [(Total assets % Current liabilities) " Weighted-average cost of capital].
LO3 Explain how a manager can improve ROI by increasing either the sales margin or capital
turnover. An investment center’s ROI equals sales margin multiplied by capital turnover. Therefore,
an investment center’s ROI may be improved by increasing either the sales margin or capital turnover.
LO4 Describe some advantages and disadvantages of both ROI and residual income as divisional
performance measures. Each of these performance measures relates an investment center’s income
to the capital invested to earn it. However, residual income and EVA have the additional advantage of
incorporating the organization’s cost of acquiring capital in the performance measure.
LO5 Explain how to measure a division’s income and invested capital. There are several ways that
investment centers’ invested capital is measured in practice. Among the commonly observed measures
are: total assets, total productive assets, and total assets less current liabilities. Similarly, several mea-
sures of investment center income are observed in practice. As explained in the chapter, these income
measures differ on the degree to which certain expenses are controllable at the investment center level.
LO6 Use the general economic rule to set an optimal transfer price. The general rule states that the
transfer price should be equal to the outlay cost incurred to make the transfer plus the organization’s
opportunity cost associated with the transfer.
LO7 Explain how to base a transfer price on market prices, costs, or negotiations. Due to difficul-
ties in implementing the general transfer pricing rule, most companies base transfer prices on external
market prices, costs, or negotiations. Market prices may be the best practical measure, as long as an
external market for the transferred product exists. Alternatively, transfer prices may be based on full,
absorption product costs or variable product costs. Negotiation, although widely used in setting transfer
prices, can be time-consuming and divisive.
LO8 Understand the behavioral issues of incentives, goal congruence, and internal controls. In gen-
eral, companies use investment center performance measures and transfer pricing methods to provide incen-
tives to managers to make goal-congruent decisions. In some cases, both investment center performance
measures and transfer prices may result in dysfunctional decisions by mid-level managers. Top management
then must weigh the benefits of intervening to prevent suboptimal decisions and the costs of undermining
divisional autonomy. Internal controls also are used in organizations to promote the effectiveness and effi-
ciency of operations, the reliability of financial reporting, and compliance with laws and regulations.

Top management is anxious to introduce the positioning system; however, unless the transfer is
made, an introduction will not be possible because of the difficulty of obtaining needed diode reducers.
Birmingham and Tampa are in the process of recovering from previous financial problems, and neither
division can afford any future losses. The company uses responsibility accounting and ROI in measuring
divisional performance, and awards bonuses to divisional management.

Mining Division: $15,200,000 plus 10 percent. Unlimited quantities of toldine can be purchased and sold on the open market at $90 per
unit. While the Mining Division could sell all the toldine it produces at $90 per unit on the open market,
it would incur a variable selling cost of $5 per unit.
Brian Jones, manager of the Mining Division, is unhappy with having to transfer the entire output
of toldine to the Metals Division at 110 percent of cost. In a meeting with the management of Provo,
he said, “Why should my division be required to sell toldine to the Metals Division at less than market
price? For the year just ended in May, Metals’ contribution margin was over $19 million on sales of
400,000 units, while Mining’s contribution was just over $5 million on the transfer of the same number
of units. My division is subsidizing the profitability of the Metals Division. We should be allowed to
charge the market price for toldine when transferring to the Metals Division.”
The following table shows the detailed unit cost structure for both the Mining and Metals divisions
during the most recent year.

2. Using the market price as the transfer price, determine the contribution margin for both the Mining
Division and the Metals Division.
3. If Provo Consolidated Resources Company were to institute the use of negotiated transfer prices
and allow divisions to buy and sell on the open market, determine the price range for toldine that
would be acceptable to both the Mining Division and the Metals Division. Explain your answer.
4. Use the general transfer-pricing rule to compute the lowest transfer price that would be accept-
able to the Mining Division. Is your answer consistent with your conclusion in requirement (3)?
Explain.
5. Identify which one of the three types of transfer prices (cost-based, market-based, or negotiated) is
most likely to elicit desirable management behavior at PCRC. Explain your answer.

$120,000
assets could be acquired for an investment of $3.2 million and has strongly urged Bill Grieco, division
manager of HEC, to consider acquiring RLI.
Grieco has reviewed RLI’s financial statements with his controller, Marie Donnelly, and they
believe the acquisition may not be in the best interest of HEC. “If we decide not to do this, the New
Age people are not going to be happy,” said Grieco. “If we could convince them to base our bonuses
on something other than return on investment, maybe this acquisition would look more attractive. How
would we do if the bonuses were based on residual income, using the company’s 15 percent cost of
capital?”
New Age Industries traditionally has evaluated all of its divisions on the basis of return on invest-
ment. The desired rate of return for each division is 20 percent. The management team of any division
reporting an annual increase in the ROI is automatically eligible for a bonus. The management of divi-
sions reporting a decline in the ROI must provide convincing explanations for the decline in order to be
eligible for a bonus. Moreover, this bonus is limited to 50 percent of the bonus paid to divisions report-
ing an increase in ROI.

Air Comfort’s division manager believes sales can be increased if the price of the air-conditioners
is reduced. A market research study by an independent firm indicates that a 5 percent reduction in the
selling price would increase sales volume 16 percent, or 2,400 units. The division has sufficient produc-
tion capacity to manage this increased volume with no increase in fixed costs.
The Air Comfort Division uses a compressor in its units, which it purchases from an outside sup-
plier at a cost of $70 per compressor. The Air Comfort Division manager has asked the manager of the
Compressor Division about selling compressor units to Air Comfort. The Compressor Division cur-
rently manufactures and sells a unit to outside firms that is similar to the unit used by the Air Comfort
Division. The specifications of the Air Comfort Division compressor are slightly different, which would
reduce the Compressor Division’s direct material cost by $1.50 per unit. In addition, the Compressor
Division would not incur any variable selling costs in the units sold to the Air Comfort Division. The
manager of the Air Comfort Division wants all of the compressors it uses to come from one supplier and
has offered to pay $50 for each compressor unit.
The Compressor Division has the capacity to produce 75,000 units. Its budgeted income statement

materials in the high-density panel run substantially more than the cost of materials in the low-density $112.00
panels. Production costs are summarized as follows:
LDP HDP
Unskilled labor (.5 hour @ $10) ................................................................................................... $ 5 $ 5
Skilled labor:
LDP (.25 hour @ $20) ............................................................................................................. 5

Variable overhead ....................................................................................................................... 5 15
Total variable cost ....................................................................................................................... $22 $70
The annual fixed overhead in the Hudson Bay Division is $1,000,000. There is a limited supply
of skilled labor available in the area, and the division must constrain its production to 40,000 hours of
skilled labor each year. This has been a troublesome problem for Jacqueline Ducharme, the division
manager. Ducharme has successfully increased demand for the LDP line to the point where it is essen-
tially unlimited. Each LDP sells for $28. Business also has increased in recent years for the HDP, and
Ducharme estimates the division could now sell anywhere up to 6,000 units per year at a price of $115.
On the other side of the Atlantic, General Instrumentation operates its Volkmar Tachometer Divi-
sion in Berlin. A recent acquisition of General Instrumentation, the division was formerly a German
company known as Volkmar Construction Instruments. The division’s main product is a sophisticated
tachometer used in heavy-duty cranes, bulldozers, and backhoes. The instrument, designated as a
TCH–320, has the following production costs.

The cost of purchased components includes a $145 control pack currently imported from Japan.
Fixed overhead in the Volkmar Tachometer Division runs about $800,000 per year. Both skilled and
unskilled labor are in abundant supply. The TCH–320 sells for $270.
Bertram Mueller, the division manager of the Volkmar Tachometer Division, recently attended a
high-level corporate meeting in Baltimore. In a conversation with Jacqueline Ducharme, it was appar-
ent that Hudson Bay’s high-density panel might be a viable substitute for the control pack currently
imported from Japan and used in Volkmar’s TCH–320. Upon returning to Berlin, Mueller asked his
chief engineer to look into the matter. Hans Schmidt obtained several HDP units from Hudson Bay, and
a minor R&D project was mounted to determine if the HDP could replace the Japanese control pack.
Several weeks later, the following conversation occurred in Mueller’s office:
Schmidt: There’s no question that Hudson Bay’s HDP unit will work in our TCH–320. In fact, it
could save us some money.
Mueller: That’s good news. If we can buy our components within the company, we’ll help
Baltimore’s bottom line without hurting ours. Also, it will look good to the brass at corporate
if they see us working hard to integrate our division into General Instrumentation’s overall
production program.
Schmidt: I’ve also been worried about the reliability of supply of the control pack. I don’t like
being dependent on such a critical supplier that way.
Mueller: I agree. Let’s look at your figures on the HDP replacement.
Schmidt: I got together with the controller’s people, and we worked up some numbers. If we
replace the control pack with the HDP from Canada, we’ll avoid the $145 control pack
cost we’re now incurring. In addition, I figure we’ll save $5.50 on the basic raw materials.
There is one catch, though. The HDP will require some adjustments in order to use it in the
TCH–320. We can make the adjustments here in Berlin. I’m guessing it will require an addi-
tional two hours of skilled labor to make the necessary modifications. I don’t think variable
overhead would be any different. Then there is the cost of transporting the HDPs to Berlin.
Let’s figure on $4.50 per unit.
Mueller: Sounds good. I’ll give Jacqueline Ducharme a call and talk this over. We can use up to
10,000 of the HDP units per year given the demand for the TCH–320. I wonder what kind of
a transfer price Hudson Bay will want.
Required:
1. Draw a simple diagram depicting the two divisions and their products. Also show the two alterna-
tives that the Volkmar Tachometer Division has in the production of its TCH–320.
2. From the perspective of General Instrumentation’s top management, should any of the TCH–320
units be produced using the high-density panel? If so, how many?
3. Suppose Hudson Bay transfers 10,000 HDP units per year to Volkmar. From the perspective of
General Instrumentation’s top management, what effect will the transfer price have on the com-
pany’s income?
4. What is the minimum transfer price that the Hudson Bay Division would find acceptable for the
HDP?
5. What is the maximum transfer price that the Volkmar Tachometer Division would find acceptable
for the HDP?
6. As the corporate controller for General Instrumentation, recommend a transfer price.

THIS CHAPTER’S FOCUS COMPANY is Worldwide Airways, an inter-
national airline based in Atlanta, Georgia. Using this service-industry
company for our illustration, we will explore a variety of decisions that managers make
routinely. Examples of such decisions are accepting or rejecting a special offer for the
company’s services, outsourcing a service, and adding or dropping a service or department.
We will find in this chapter that different kinds of cost information are relevant, depending
on the type of decision to be made.

In contrast to the transportation-services setting of Worldwide Airways, we
will explore certain types of decisions that most often arise in a manufac-

produces a variety of chocolate products. In addition to producing chocolate candy, the
company processes cocoa beans into cocoa powder and cocoa butter. The cocoa powder
can then be processed further into instant cocoa mix. We will explore a variety of decisions

Decision making is a fundamental part of management. Decisions about the acquisition
of equipment, mix of products, methods of production, and pricing of products and ser-
vices confront managers in all types of organizations. This chapter covers the role of
managerial accounting information in a variety of common decisions. The next chapter
examines pricing decisions.
The Managerial Accountant’s Role in Decision Making
Managerial accountants are increasingly playing important roles as full-fledged members
of cross-functional management teams. These management teams face a broad array of
decisions, including production, marketing, financial, and other decisions. All managers
and management teams need information pertinent to their decisions. In support of the
decision-making process, managerial accountants play a specific role in providing rel-
evant information. Thus, the managerial accountant must have a good understanding of
the decisions faced by managers throughout the organization.

Chapter 14 Decision Making: Relevant Costs and Benefits 593
Steps in the Decision-Making Process
Seven steps characterize the decision-making process:
1. Clarify the decision problem. Sometimes the decision to be made is clear. For
Learning Objective 1
example, if a company receives a special order for its product at a price below
the usual price, the decision problem is to accept or reject the order. But the Describe seven steps in the
decision problem is seldom so clear and unambiguous. Perhaps demand for decision-making process and

product on the market? Before a decision can be made, the problem needs to be
clarified and defined in more specific terms. Considerable managerial skill is
required to define a decision problem in terms that can be addressed effectively.
2. Specify the criterion. Once a decision problem has been clarified, the
manager should specify the criterion upon which a decision will be made. “We are looked upon as

than one defective part in 1,000 manufactured units. Caterpillar
3. Identify the alternatives. A decision involves selecting between two or more
alternatives. If a machine breaks down, what are the alternative courses of
action? The machine can be repaired or replaced, or a replacement can be
leased. But perhaps repair will turn out to be more costly than replacement.
Determining the possible alternatives is a critical step in the decision process.
4. Develop a decision model. A d ecision model is a simplified representation of the
choice problem. Unnecessary details are stripped away, and the most important
elements of the problem are highlighted. Thus, the decision model brings together
the elements listed above: the criterion, the constraints, and the alternatives.
5. C ollect the data. Although the managerial accountant often is involved in steps 1
through 4, he or she is chiefly responsible for step 5. Selecting data pertinent
to decisions is one of the managerial accountant’s most important roles in an
organization.
6. S elect an alternative. Once the decision model is formulated and the pertinent
data are collected, the appropriate manager makes a decision.
7. E valuate decision effectiveness. After a decision has been implemented, the results
of the decision are evaluated with the objective of improving future decisions.
Quantitative versus Qualitative Analysis
Decision problems involving accounting data typically are specified in quantitative
Learning Objective 2
terms. The criteria in such problems usually include objectives such as profit maxi-
mization or cost minimization. When a manager makes a final decision, however, the Explain the relationship
qualitative characteristics of the alternatives can be just as important as the quantitative between quantitative and
measures. Q ualitative characteristics are the factors in a decision problem that cannot qualitative analyses in decision
be expressed effectively in numerical terms. To illustrate, suppose Worldwide Airways’ making.
top management is considering the elimination of its hub operation in London. Airlines
establish hubs at airports where many of their routes intersect. Hub operations include
facilities for in-flight food preparation, aircraft maintenance and storage, and adminis-
trative offices. A careful quantitative analysis indicates that Worldwide Airways’ profit-
maximizing alternative is to eliminate the London hub. In making its decision, however,
the company’s managers will consider such qualitative issues as the effect of the closing
on its London employees and on the morale of its remaining employees in the airline’s
Paris, Atlanta, and Tokyo hubs.

================================================================================

594 Chapter 14 Decision Making: Relevant Costs and Benefits
To clarify what is at stake in such qualitative analyses, quantitative analysis can allow
the decision maker to put a “price” on the sum total of the qualitative characteristics.
For example, suppose Worldwide Airways’ controller gives top management a quantita-
tive analysis showing that elimination of the London hub will increase annual profits by
$2,000,000. However, the qualitative considerations favor the option of continuing the
London operation. How important are these qualitative considerations to the top man-
agers? If they decide to continue the London operation, the qualitative considerations
must be worth at least $2,000,000 to them. Weighing the quantitative and qualitative
considerations in making decisions is the essence of management. The skill, experience,
judgment, and ethical standards of managers all come to bear on such difficult choices.
Exhibit 14–1 depicts the seven steps in the decision process, and the relationship
between quantitative and qualitative analysis.
Obtaining Information: Relevance, Accuracy, and Timeliness
What criteria should the managerial accountant use in designing the accounting informa-
tion system that supplies data for decision making? Three characteristics of information
determine its usefulness.
Relevance Information is relevant if it is pertinent to a decision problem. Different
decisions typically will require different data. The primary theme of this chapter is how
to decide what information is relevant to various common decision problems.
Accuracy Information that is pertinent to a decision problem also must be accurate,
or it will be of little use. This means the information must be precise. For example, the
cost incurred by Worldwide Airways to rent facilities at London’s Heathrow Airport is

Chapter 14 Decision Making: Relevant Costs and Benefits 595
relevant to a decision about eliminating the airline’s London hub. However, if the rental
cost data are imprecise, due to incomplete or misplaced records, the usefulness of the
information will be diminished.
Conversely, highly accurate but irrelevant data are of no value to a decision maker.
Suppose Worldwide Airways will continue its daily round-trip flight between New York
and London regardless of its decision about eliminating the London hub. Precise data
about fuel consumption on the New York–London route are irrelevant to the decision
about closing down the London hub.
Timeliness Relevant and accurate data are of value only if they are t imely, that is,
available in time for a decision. Thus, timeliness is the third important criterion for deter-
mining the usefulness of information. Some situations involve a trade-off between the
accuracy and the timeliness of information. More accurate information may take lon-
ger to produce. Therefore, as accuracy improves, timeliness suffers, and vice versa. For
example, a company may test-market a potential new product in a particular city. The
longer the test-marketing program runs, the more accurate will be the marketing data
generated. However, a long wait for the accurate marketing report may unduly delay
management’s decision to launch the new product nationally.
To summarize, the managerial accountant’s primary role in the decision-making
process is twofold:
1. Decide what information is r elevant to each decision problem.
2. Provide a ccurate and timely data, keeping in mind the proper balance between
these often-conflicting criteria.
Relevant Information
What makes information relevant to a decision problem? Two criteria are important.

event. The cost information relevant to Worldwide Airways’ decision concerning its information.
London operations involves the costs that w ill be incurred in the future under the airline’s
two alternatives. Costs incurred in the past in the airline’s London operations will not
change regardless of management’s decision, and they are irrelevant to the decision at
hand.
Since relevant information involves future events, the managerial accountant must
predict the amounts of the relevant costs and benefits. In making these predictions, the
accountant often will use estimates of cost behavior based on historical data. There is an
important and subtle issue here. Relevant information must involve costs and benefits
to be realized in the future. However, the accountant’s p redictions of those costs and
benefits often are based on data from the p ast.
Different under Competing Alternatives Relevant information must
involve costs or benefits that differ among the alternatives. Costs or benefits that are the “You have to try to sum-

================================================================================
PAGE 631
================================================================================

596 Chapter 14 Decision Making: Relevant Costs and Benefits
requires a special analysis by the managerial accountant. The relevant information
often will be found in many diverse places in the organization’s overall information
system.
In contrast, repetitive decisions are made over and over again, at either regular or
irregular intervals. For example, Worldwide Airways makes route-scheduling deci-
sions every six months. Such a routine decision makes it worthwhile for the mana-
gerial accountant to keep a special file of the information relevant to the scheduling
decision.
Cost predictions relevant to repetitive decisions typically can draw on a large amount
of historical data. Since the decisions have been made repeatedly in the past, the data
from those decisions should be readily available. Information relevant to unique deci-
sions is harder to generate. The managerial accountant typically will have to give more
thought to deciding which data are relevant, and will have less historical data available
upon which to base predictions.
Importance of Identifying Relevant Costs and Benefits
Why is it important for the managerial accountant to isolate the relevant costs and
benefits in a decision analysis? The reasons are twofold. First, generating information is
a costly process. The relevant data must be sought, and this requires time and effort. By
focusing on only the relevant information, the managerial accountant can simplify and
shorten the data-gathering process.
Second, people can effectively use only a limited amount of information. Beyond
this, they experience information overload, and their decision-making effectiveness
declines. By routinely providing only information about relevant costs and benefits, the
managerial accountant can reduce the likelihood of information overload.
Identifying Relevant Costs and Benefits
To illustrate how managerial accountants determine relevant costs and benefits, we will

treatment to sunk costs,
opportunity costs, and unit
costs. Sunk Costs
Sunk costs are costs that have already been incurred. They do not affect any future
cost and cannot be changed by any current or future action. Sunk costs are irrelevant to
decisions, as the following two examples show.
Book Value of Equipment At Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, Worldwide
Airways has a three-year-old loader truck used to load in-flight meals onto airplanes.
The box on the truck can be lifted hydraulically to the level of a jumbo jet’s side doors.
The book value of this loader, defined as the asset’s acquisition cost less the accumulated
depreciation to date, is computed as follows:
Acquisition cost of old loader ......................................................................................................................... $100,000
Less: Accumulated depreciation ..................................................................................................................... 75,000
Book value .................................................................................................................................................... $ 25,000
The loader has one year of useful life remaining, after which its salvage value will
be zero. However, it could be sold now for $5,000. In addition to the annual depreciation

================================================================================
PAGE 632
================================================================================

Chapter 14 Decision Making: Relevant Costs and Benefits 597
of $25,000, Worldwide Airways annually incurs $80,000 in variable costs to operate the
loader. These include the costs of operator labor, gasoline, and maintenance.
John Orville, Worldwide Airways’ ramp manager at Charles de Gaulle Airport, faces
a decision about replacement of the loader. A new kind of loader uses a conveyor belt
to move meals into an airplane. The new loader is much cheaper than the old hydraulic
loader and costs less to operate. However, the new loader would be operable for only
one year before it would need to be replaced. Pertinent data about the new loader are as
follows:
Acquisition cost of new loader ......................................................................................................................... $15,000
Useful life ....................................................................................................................................................... 1 year
Salvage value after one year ............................................................................................................................ 0
Annual depreciation ........................................................................................................................................ $15,000
Annual operating costs .................................................................................................................................... $45,000
Orville’s initial inclination is to continue using the old loader for another year. He
exclaims, “We can’t dump that equipment now. We paid $100,000 for it, and we’ve only
used it three years. If we get rid of that loader now, we’ll lose $20,000 on the disposal.”
Orville reasons that the old loader’s book value of $25,000, less its current salvage value
of $5,000, amounts to a loss of $20,000.
Fortunately, Orville’s comment is overheard by Joan Wilbur, the managerial accoun-
tant in the company’s Charles de Gaulle Airport administrative offices. Wilbur points out
to Orville that the book value of the old loader is a sunk cost. It cannot affect any future
cost the company might incur. To convince Orville that she is right, Wilbur prepares the
analysis shown in Exhibit 14–2 .
Regardless of which alternative is selected, the $25,000 book value of the old loader
will be an expense or loss in the next year. If the old loader is kept in service, the $25,000
will be recognized as depreciation expense; otherwise, the $25,000 cost will be incurred
by the company as a write-off of the asset’s book value. Thus, the current book value of
the old loader is a s unk cost and irrelevant to the replacement decision.
Notice that the relevant data in the equipment replacement decision are items (3), (4),
“[We are continually moving]

item (4), is a future cost incurred only under the “replace” alternative. The operating cost,
item (5), is also a future cost that differs between the two alternatives.
Differential Costs Exhibit 14–2 includes a column entitled D ifferential Cost. A
differential cost is the difference in a cost item under two decision alternatives. The com-
putation of differential costs is a convenient way of summarizing the relative advantage
of one alternative over the other. John Orville can make a correct equipment-replacement
decision in either of two ways: (1) by comparing the total cost of the two alternatives,
shown in columns (a) and (b); or (2) by focusing on the total differential cost, shown in
column (c), which favors the “replacement” option.
Cost of Inventory on Hand Never having taken a managerial accounting course
in college, John Orville is slow to learn how to identify sunk costs. The next week he
goofs again.
The inventory of spare aircraft parts held by Worldwide Airways at Charles de
Gaulle includes some obsolete parts originally costing $20,000. The company no longer
uses the planes for which the parts were purchased. The obsolete parts include spare
passenger seats, luggage racks, and galley equipment. The spare parts could be sold to
another airline for $17,000. However, with some modifications, the obsolete parts could
still be used in the company’s current fleet of aircraft. Using the modified parts would
save Worldwide Airways the cost of purchasing new parts for its airplanes.
John Orville decides not to dispose of the obsolete parts, because doing so would
entail a loss of $3,000. Orville reasons that the $20,000 book value of the parts, less the
$17,000 proceeds from disposal, would result in a $3,000 loss on disposal. Joan Wilbur,
the managerial accountant, comes to the rescue again, demonstrating that the right decision
is to dispose of the parts. Wilbur’s analysis is shown in Exhibit 14–3 .
Notice that the book value of the obsolete inventory is a sunk cost. If the parts are
modified, the $20,000 book value will be an expense during the period when the parts
are used. Otherwise, the $20,000 book value of the asset will be written off when the
parts are sold. As a sunk cost, the book value of the obsolete inventory will not affect any
future cash flow of the company.
As the managerial accountant’s analysis reveals, the relevant data include the
$17,000 proceeds from disposal, the $12,000 cost to modify the parts, and the $26,000
cost to buy new parts. All of these data meet the two tests of relevance: they affect future
cash flows and they differ between the two alternatives. As Joan Wilbur’s analysis shows,
Worldwide Airways’ cost will be $3,000 less if the obsolete parts are sold and new parts
are purchased.

Irrelevant Future Costs and Benefits
At Worldwide Airways’ headquarters in Atlanta, Amy Earhart, manager of flight sched-
uling, is in the midst of making a decision about the Atlanta to Honolulu route. The
flight is currently nonstop, but she is considering a stop in San Francisco. She feels that
the route would attract additional passengers if the stop is made, but there also would be
additional variable costs. Her analysis appears in Exhibit 14–4 .
The analysis indicates that the preferable alternative is the route that includes a stop
in San Francisco. Notice that the cargo revenue [item (2)] and the aircraft maintenance
cost [item (8)] are irrelevant to the flight-route decision. Although these data do affect
future cash flows, they d o not differ between the two alternatives. All of the other data in
Exhibit 14–4 are relevant to the decision, because they do differ between the two alterna-
tives. The analysis in Exhibit 14–4 could have ignored the irrelevant data; the same deci-
sion would have been reached. ( Exercise 14–30 , at the end of the chapter, will ask you to
prove this assertion by redoing the analysis without the irrelevant data.)
Opportunity Costs
Another decision confronting Amy Earhart is whether to add two daily round-trip flights
between Atlanta and Montreal. Her initial analysis of the relevant costs and benefits indi-
cates that the additional revenue from the flights will exceed their costs by $30,000 per
month. Hence, she is ready to add the flights to the schedule. However, Chuck Lindbergh,
Worldwide Airways’ hangar manager in Atlanta, points out that Earhart has overlooked
an important consideration.
Worldwide Airways currently has excess space in its hangar. A commuter airline
has offered to rent the hangar space for $40,000 per month. However, if the Atlanta-to-
Montreal flights are added to the schedule, the additional aircraft needed in Atlanta will
require the excess hangar space.
If Worldwide Airways adds the Atlanta-to-Montreal flights, it will forgo the oppor-
tunity to rent the excess hangar space for $40,000 per month. Thus, the $40,000 in rent
forgone is an o pportunity cost of the alternative to add the new flights. An o pportunity
cost is the potential benefit given up when the choice of one action precludes a different
action. Although people tend to overlook or underestimate the importance of opportu-
nity costs, they are just as relevant as out-of-pocket costs in evaluating decision alterna-
tives. In Worldwide Airways’ case, the best action is to rent the excess warehouse space
to the commuter airline, rather than adding the new flights. The analysis in Exhibit 14–5
supports this conclusion.

*Parentheses denote that differential benefit favors option (b).
It is a common mistake for people to overlook or underweigh opportunity costs. The
$40,000 hangar rental, which will be forgone if the new flights are added, is an opportu-
nity cost of the option to add the flights. It is a r elevant cost of the decision, and it is just
as important as any out-of-pocket expenditure.
Summary
Relevant costs and benefits satisfy the following two criteria:
1. They affect the future.
2. They differ between alternatives.
Sunk costs are not relevant costs, because they do not affect the future. An example

identifying the relevant costs
and benefits.
Accept or Reject a Special Offer
Jim Wright, Worldwide Airways’ vice president for operations, has been approached by
a Japanese tourist agency about flying chartered tourist flights from Japan to Hawaii. The
tourist agency has offered Worldwide Airways $150,000 per round-trip flight on a jumbo
jet. Given the airline’s usual occupancy rate and air fares, a round-trip jumbo-jet flight
between Japan and Hawaii typically brings in revenue of $250,000. Thus, the tourist
agency’s specially priced offer requires a special analysis by Jim Wright.
Wright knows that Worldwide Airways has two jumbo jets that are not currently in
use. The airline has just eliminated several unprofitable routes, freeing these aircraft for
other uses. The airline was not currently planning to add any new routes, and therefore
the two jets were idle. To help make his decision, Wright asks for cost data from the con-
troller’s office. The controller provides the information in Exhibit 14–6 , which pertains to
a typical round-trip jumbo-jet flight between Japan and Hawaii.
The variable costs cover aircraft fuel and maintenance, flight-crew costs, in-flight
meals and services, and landing fees. The fixed costs allocated to each flight cover World-
wide Airways’ fixed costs, such as aircraft depreciation, maintenance and depreciation of
facilities, and fixed administrative costs.

Total cost per flight ....................................................................................................................................... 190,000
Loss on charter flight ................................................................................................................................... $ (40,000)
This calculation suggests that the special charter offer should be rejected. What is
the error in this analysis? The mistake is the inclusion of allocated fixed costs in the cost
per flight. This is an error, because the fixed costs will not increase in total if the charter
flight is added. Since the fixed costs will not change under either of the alternate choices,
they are irrelevant.
Fortunately, Jim Wright does not make this mistake. He knows that only the variable
costs of the proposed charter are relevant. Moreover, Wright determines that the variable cost
of the charter would be less than that of a typical flight, because Worldwide Airways would
not incur the variable costs of reservations and ticketing. These variable expenses amount to
$5,000 for a scheduled flight. Thus, Wright’s analysis of the charter offer is as shown below.

Variable cost of charter .............................................................................. 85,000

Wright’s analysis shows that the special charter flight will contribute $65,000 toward
covering the airline’s fixed costs and profit. Since the airline has excess flight capacity, due “I’ve seen it (managerial

Thus, if Worldwide Airways has no excess flight capacity, Jim Wright should reject
the special charter offer.
Summary The decision to accept or reject a specially priced order is common in
both service-industry and manufacturing firms. Manufacturers often are faced with deci-
sions about selling products in a special order at less than full price. The correct analysis
of such decisions focuses on the relevant costs and benefits. Fixed costs, which often
are allocated to individual units of product or service, are usually irrelevant. Fixed costs
typically will not change in total, whether the order is accepted or rejected.
When excess capacity exists, the only relevant costs usually will be the variable
costs associated with the special order. When there is no excess capacity, the oppor-
tunity cost of using the firm’s facilities for the special order is also relevant to the
decision.
Outsource a Product or Service
Ellie Rickenbacker is Worldwide Airways’ manager of in-flight services. She supervises
the airline’s flight attendants and all of the firm’s food and beverage operations. Rick-
enbacker currently faces a decision regarding the preparation of in-flight dinners at the
airline’s Atlanta hub. In the Atlanta flight kitchen, full-course dinners are prepared and
packaged for long flights that pass through Atlanta. In the past, all of the desserts were
baked and packaged in the flight kitchen. However, Rickenbacker has received an offer
from an Atlanta bakery to bake the airline’s desserts. Thus, her decision is whether to o ut-
source the dessert portion of the in-flight dinners. An outsourcing decision, also called a
make-or-buy decision, entails a choice between producing a product or service in-house
and purchasing it from an outside supplier. To help guide her decision, Rickenbacker has
assembled the cost information in Exhibit 14–7 , which shows a total cost per dessert of
25 cents.
The Atlanta bakery has offered to supply the desserts for 21 cents each. Rickenbacker’s
initial inclination is to accept the bakery’s offer, since it appears that the airline would
save 4 cents per dessert. However, the controller reminds Rickenbacker that not all of
the costs listed in Exhibit 14–7 are relevant to the outsourcing decision. The controller
modifies Rickenbacker’s analysis as shown in Exhibit 14–8 .
If Worldwide Airways stops making desserts, it will save all of the variable costs
but only 1 cent of fixed costs. The 1-cent saving in supervisory salaries would result
because the airline could get along with two fewer kitchen supervisors. The remainder
of the fixed costs would be incurred even if the desserts were purchased. These remain-
ing fixed costs of supervision and depreciation would have to be reallocated to the flight
kitchen’s other products. In light of the controller’s revised analysis, Rickenbacker real-
izes that the airline should continue to make its own desserts. To outsource the desserts
would require an expenditure of 21 cents per dessert, but only 15 cents per dessert would
be saved.

OUTSOURCING A ccounting
Outsourcing is widely used in a variety of businesses. The management at Northwest P ractice
Airlines, for example, has decided to outsource some of its flight attendants in order to
Northwest, JetBlue,
reduce the cost of filling the most expensive of these positions. According to T he Wall
America West, Apple,
Street Journal, it’s a sign “that Northwest, which has filed for bankruptcy protection,
Dell, Hewlett-Packard,
wants to become a ‘virtual airline,’ with all sorts of jobs previously claimed by organized
Motorola, Nokia, Canon,
labor outsourced to cheaper workers, some overseas.”
Kodak, and Nikon
Other airlines are outsourcing key maintenance operations. J etBlue Airways “will fly at
least 17 of its 68 Airbus A320 jets to” El Salvador. “There, over six days, local mechanics
working for an aircraft-overhaul shop under contract to JetBlue will inspect each plane
nose to tail.” After any required maintenance is performed, the jets will fly back to the U.S.
A merica West Airlines also is flying its planes to El Salvador for inspections required by the
FAA. “Northwest Airlines flies its wide-body jets to Singapore and Hong Kong for service
by outside contractors.”
BusinessWeek reports that many technology manufacturers are outsourcing
research and development and product design to outside contractors in Taiwan and
other countries. Among the companies outsourcing some of these key design func-
tions are computer manufacturers A pple, Dell, and Hewlett-Packard, and wireless phone
manufacturers Motorola and Nokia. Camera manufacturers Canon, Kodak, and Nikon also
outsource designs of some low-end models.1
To clarify her decision further, Rickenbacker asks the controller to prepare an analy-
sis of the t otal costs per month of making or buying desserts. The controller’s report,
displayed in Exhibit 14–9 , shows the total cost of producing 1,000,000 desserts, the flight
kitchen’s average monthly volume. 1
The total-cost analysis confirmed Rickenbacker’s decision to continue making
desserts in the airline’s flight kitchen.

In today’s global economy, more and more companies are outsourcing significant products
and services. G allo Winery, for example, buys a significant portion of its grapes from other
vintners. K odak outsources its entire data processing operation. Cummins Engine outsources
many of its pistons, and I ntel Corporation buys microchips. Chase Bank outsources its
cafeteria and legal services. Many pharmaceutical companies, such as Japan’s Yamanouchi
Pharmaceutical , have outsourced much of their production to cut costs. 2 Pictured here are
grape harvesting and pharmaceutical production.
Beware of Unit-Cost Data Fixed costs often are allocated to individual units
of product or service for product-costing purposes. For decision-making purposes, how-
ever, unitized fixed costs can be misleading. As the total-cost analysis in Exhibit 14–9
shows, only $10,000 in fixed monthly cost will be saved if the desserts are purchased. The
remaining $100,000 in monthly fixed cost will continue whether the desserts are made or

purchased. Rickenbacker’s initial cost analysis in Exhibit 14–7 implies that each dessert
costs the airline 25 cents, but that 25-cent cost includes 11 cents of unitized fixed costs.
Most of these costs will remain unchanged regardless of the outsourcing decision. By
allocating fixed costs to individual products or services, they are made to appear variable
even though they are not.
Add or Drop a Service, Product, or Department
Worldwide Airways offers its passengers the opportunity to join its World Express
Club. Club membership entitles a traveler to use the club facilities at the airport in
Atlanta. Club privileges include a private lounge and restaurant, discounts on meals and
beverages, and use of a small health spa.
Jayne Wing, the president of Worldwide Airways, is worried that the World Express
Club might not be profitable. Her concern is caused by the statement of monthly operat-
ing income shown in the Excel spreadsheet in Exhibit 14–10 .
In her weekly staff meeting, Wing states her concern about the World Express Club’s
profitability. The controller responds by pointing out that not all of the costs on the club’s
income statement would be eliminated if the club were discontinued. The vice president
for sales adds that the club helps Worldwide Airways attract passengers who it might
otherwise lose to a competitor. As the meeting adjourns, Wing asks the controller to
prepare an analysis of the relevant costs and benefits associated with the World Express
Club. The controller’s analysis is displayed in Exhibit 14–11 .
The controller’s analysis in Exhibit 14–11 contains two parts. Part I focuses on the
relevant costs and benefits of the World Express Club only, while ignoring any impact
of the club on other airline operations. In column (a), the controller has listed the
club’s revenues and expenses from the income statement presented in Exhibit 14–10 .
Column (b) in Exhibit 14–11 lists the expenses that will continue if the club is eliminated.
These expenses are called unavoidable expenses. In contrast, the expenses appearing in
column (a) but not column (b) are avoidable expenses. The airline will no longer incur
these expenses if the club is eliminated.

Part II:

*The positive $40,000 differential amount reflects the fact that the company is $40,000 better off by keeping the club.
Notice that all of the club’s variable expenses are avoidable. The depreciation
expense, $30,000, is an allocated portion of the depreciation on a Worldwide Airways
building, part of which is used by the World Express Club. If the Club is discontinued,
the airline will continue to own and use the building, and the depreciation expense will
continue. Thus, it is an unavoidable expense. The fixed supervisory salaries are avoid-
able, since these employees will no longer be needed if the club is eliminated. The fixed
insurance expense of $10,000 is not avoidable; the $5,000 fee paid to the airport for the
privilege of operating the club is avoidable. Finally, the club’s allocated portion of gen-
eral overhead expenses, $10,000, is not avoidable. Worldwide Airways will incur these
expenses regardless of its decision about the World Express Club.
The conclusion shown by Part I of the controller’s report is that the club should not
be eliminated. If the club is closed, the airline will lose more in contribution margin,
$65,000, than it saves in avoidable fixed expenses, $25,000. Thus, the club’s $65,000
contribution margin is enough to cover the avoidable fixed expenses of $25,000 and still
contribute $40,000 toward covering the overall airline’s fixed expenses.
World Express Club’s contribution margin ............................................................................................................ $65,000
Avoidable fixed expenses .................................................................................................................................... 25,000
Contribution of club toward covering overall airline’s fixed expenses ...................................................................... $40,000
Now consider Part II of the controller’s analysis in Exhibit 14–11 . As the vice presi-
dent for sales pointed out, the World Express Club is an attractive feature to many trav-
elers. The controller estimates that if the club were discontinued, the airline would lose
$60,000 each month in forgone contribution margin from general airline operations.

ADDING A SERVICE A ccounting
Changing business conditions can cause a company to rethink its business model and P ractice

FedEx and Caterpillar
night letter delivery business was eliminated by e-mail. Customers no longer needed to
ship a hard-copy document overnight, when the same document could be sent instanta-
neously via e-mail. FedEx also found a decline in the need for overnight repair parts ship-
ments. Many customers’ improved supply chain systems resulted in better spare parts
preparedness and less need for last-minute overnight shipments. FedEx responded by
adding slower ground shipment services to compete more directly with UPS and the
U.S. Postal Service. While FedEx still excels when an overnight shipment is needed, its
ground transport business is becoming an increasing part of its operations. FedEx also
is adding new technology-based services that give customers greater ability to track
shipments in transit.
Caterpillar has added heavy equipment overhaul services to its already successful
manufacturing operations. The company uses available capacity in its manufacturing
plants to disassemble and rebuild heavy diesel engines, after cleaning, inspecting, and
repairing them. This new service component of Caterpillar’s operations has become the
company’s fastest-growing business unit, with annual revenue topping $1 billion. 3
This loss in contribution margin would result from losing to a competing airline current
passengers who are attracted to Worldwide Airways by its World Express Club. This
$60,000 in forgone contribution margin is an opportunity cost of the option to close
down the club.
Considering both Parts I and II of the controller’s analysis, Worldwide Airways’
monthly profit will be greater by $100,000 if the club is kept open. Recognition of two
issues is key to this conclusion:3
1. Only the avoidable expenses of the club will be saved if it is discontinued.
2. Closing the club will adversely affect the airline’s other operations.

products are identifiable as separate products is called the split-off point. Other exam-
ples of joint production processes include the slaughtering of animals for various cuts
of meat and the processing of petroleum into various products, such as kerosene and
gasoline.
Manufacturers with joint production processes sometimes must decide whether a
joint product should be sold at the split-off point or processed further before being sold.
Such a decision recently confronted Bill Candee, the president of International Chocolate
Company . Candee’s firm imports cocoa beans and processes them into cocoa powder
and cocoa butter. Only a portion of the cocoa powder is used by International Chocolate
Company in the production of chocolate candy. The remainder of the cocoa powder is
sold to an ice cream producer. Candee is considering the possibility of processing his
remaining cocoa powder into an instant cocoa mix to be marketed under the brand name
ChocoTime. Data pertaining to Candee’s decision are displayed in Exhibit 14–12 .
Notice from the diagram that cocoa beans are processed in 1-ton batches. The total
cost of the cocoa beans and the joint processing is $1,100. This is called the joint cost.
The output of the joint process is 1,500 pounds of cocoa butter and 500 pounds of cocoa
powder.
How should Bill Candee approach the decision about processing the cocoa pow-
der into instant cocoa mix? What are the relevant costs and benefits? First, let’s con-
sider the joint cost of $1,100. Is this a relevant cost in the decision at hand? T he joint
cost is not a relevant cost, because it will not change regardless of the decision Candee
makes.
Suppose the $1,100 joint cost had been allocated to the two joint products for product-
costing purposes. A common method of allocating a joint cost is the r elative-sales-value
method, in which the joint cost is allocated between the joint products in proportion to
their sales value at the split-off point.4 International Chocolate Company would make the
following joint cost allocation.

Does this allocation of the $1,100 joint cost make it relevant to the decision about
processing cocoa powder into instant cocoa mix? The answer is no. T he $1,100 joint cost
still does not change in total, whether the cocoa powder is processed further or not. The
joint cost is irrelevant to the decision at hand.
The only costs and benefits relevant to Candee’s decision are those that differ between
the two alternatives. The proper analysis is shown in Exhibit 14–13 .
There is a shortcut method that arrives at the same conclusion as Exhibit 14–13 .
In this approach, the incremental revenue from the further processing of cocoa powder
is compared with the separable processing cost, which is the cost incurred after the
split-off point, as follows:
Sales value of instant cocoa mix ........................................................................................................................... $2,000
Sales value of cocoa powder ................................................................................................................................. 500
Incremental revenue from further processing ......................................................................................................... $1,500
Less: Separable processing cost ........................................................................................................................... (800)
Net benefit from further processing ....................................................................................................................... $ 700
Both analyses indicate that Bill Candee should process his excess cocoa powder into
instant cocoa mix. The same conclusion is reached if the analysis is done on a per-unit
basis rather than a total basis:
Sales value of instant cocoa mix ($2,000 # 500 pounds) ........................................................................ $4.00 per pound
Sales value of cocoa powder ($500 # 500 pounds) ................................................................................ 1.00 per pound
Incremental revenue from further processing ........................................................................................... $3.00 per pound
Less: Separable processing cost ($800 # 500 pounds) ........................................................................... (1.60) per pound
Net benefit from further processing ......................................................................................................... $1.40 per pound
Once again, the analysis shows that Bill Candee should decide to process the cocoa
powder into instant cocoa mix.
Decisions Involving Limited Resources
Organizations typically have limited resources. Limitations on floor space, machine
time, labor hours, or raw materials are common. Operating with limited resources, a firm
often must choose between sales orders, deciding which orders to fill and which ones to
decline. In making such decisions, managers must decide which product or service is the
most profitable.

To illustrate, suppose International Chocolate Company’s Phoenix plant makes two
candy-bar products, Chewies and Chompo Bars. The contribution margin for a case of
each of these products is computed in Exhibit 14–14 .
A glance at the contribution-margin data suggests that Chompo Bars are more profit-
able than Chewies. It is true that a case of Chompo Bars contributes more toward cover-
ing the company’s fixed cost and profit. However, an important consideration has been
ignored in the analysis so far. The Phoenix plant’s capacity is limited by its available
machine time. Only 700 machine hours are available in the plant each month. Interna-
tional Chocolate Company can sell as many cases of either candy bar as it can produce,
so production is limited only by the constraint on machine time.
To maximize the plant’s total contribution toward covering fixed cost and profit,
management should strive to use each machine hour as effectively as possible. This real-
ization alters the analysis of product profitability. The relevant question is not, Which
candy bar has the highest contribution margin p er case? The pertinent question is, Which
product has the highest contribution margin p er machine hour? This question is answered
with the calculation in Exhibit 14–15 .
A machine hour spent in the production of Chewies will contribute $50 toward cover-
ing fixed cost and profit, while a machine hour devoted to Chompo Bars contributes only
$40. Hence, the Phoenix plant’s most profitable product is Chewies, when the plant’s
scarce resource is taken into account.
Suppose International Chocolate Company’s Phoenix plant manager, Candace Barr,
is faced with a choice between two sales orders, only one of which can be accepted. Only
100 hours of unscheduled machine time remains in the month, and it can be used to pro-
duce either Chewies or Chompos. The analysis in Exhibit 14–16 shows that Barr should
devote the 100-hour block of machine time to filling the order for Chewies.
As Exhibit 14–16 demonstrates, a decision about the best use of a limited resource
should be made on the basis of the c ontribution margin per unit of the scarce resource.
Multiple Scarce Resources Suppose the Phoenix plant had a limited amount of
both machine hours and labor hours. Now the analysis of product profitability is more
complicated. The choice as to which product is most profitable typically will involve a
trade-off between the two scarce resources. Solving such a problem requires a powerful
mathematical tool called l inear programming, which is covered in the appendix to this
chapter.

Theory of Constraints As the previous analysis suggests, a binding constraint
can limit a company’s profitability. For example, a manufacturing company may have
a bottleneck operation, through which every unit of a product must pass before mov-
ing on to other operations. The t heory of constraints (TOC) calls for identifying such
limiting constraints and seeking ways to relax them. Also referred to as managing con-
straints, this management approach can significantly improve an organization’s level of
goal attainment. Among the ways that management can relax a constraint by expanding
the capacity of a bottleneck operation are the following:
• Outsourcing (subcontracting) all or part of the bottleneck operation.
• Investing in additional production equipment and employing parallel process-
ing, in which multiple product units undergo the same production operation
simultaneously.
• Working overtime at the bottleneck operation.
• Retraining employees and shifting them to the bottleneck.
• Eliminating any non-value-added activities at the bottleneck operation.
Uncertainty
Our analyses of the decisions in this chapter assumed that all relevant data were known
with certainty. In practice, of course, decision makers are rarely so fortunate. One com-
mon technique for addressing the impact of uncertainty is s ensitivity analysis. Sensitivity
analysis is a technique for determining what would happen in a decision analysis if a key
prediction or assumption proved to be wrong.
To illustrate, let’s return to Candace Barr’s decision about how to use the remaining
100 hours of machine time in International Chocolate Company’s Phoenix plant. The
calculation in Exhibit 14–15 showed that Chewies have the higher contribution margin
per machine hour. Suppose Barr is uncertain about the contribution margin per case of
Chewies. A sensitivity analysis shows how sensitive her decision is to the value of this
uncertain parameter. As Exhibit 14–17 shows, the Chewies contribution margin could
decline to $.80 per case before Barr’s decision would change. As long as the contribution

Sensitivity analysis can help the managerial accountant decide which parameters
in an analysis are most critical to estimate accurately. In this case, the managerial
accountant knows that the contribution margin per case of Chewies could be as much as
20 percent lower than the original $1.00 prediction without changing the outcome of the
analysis.
Expected Values Another approach to dealing explicitly with uncertainty is to
base the decision on expected values. The expected value of a random variable is equal
to the sum of the possible values for the variable, each weighted by its probability. To
illustrate, suppose the contribution margins per case for Chewies and Chompos are uncer-
tain, as shown in Exhibit 14–18 . As the exhibit shows, the choice as to which product to
produce with excess machine time may be based on the expected value of the contribu-
tion per machine hour. Statisticians have developed many other methods for dealing with
uncertainty in decision making. These techniques are covered in statistics and decision
analysis courses.

analysis. in an advanced manufacturing setting and in a situation where activity-based costing is
used. The objective of the decision analysis is to determine the costs and benefits that are
relevant to the decision. As we found earlier in this chapter, relevant costs and benefits
have a bearing on the future and differ among the decision alternatives.
What will be different in a setting where activity-based costing is used is the decision
maker’s ability to determine what costs are relevant to a decision. Under ABC, the deci-
sion maker typically can associate costs with the activities that drive them much more
accurately than under a conventional product-costing system. Let’s explore these issues
with an illustration.
5 Activity-based costing (ABC), which was introduced conceptually in Chapter 3, is thoroughly explored in Chapter 5.
This section can be studied most effectively after completing Chapter 5.

Conventional Outsourcing (Make-or-Buy) Analysis
International Chocolate Company makes fine chocolates in its Savannah plant. The
chocolates are packaged in two-pound and five-pound gift boxes. The company also
manufactures the gift boxes in the Savannah plant. The plant manager, Marsha Mello,
was approached recently by a packaging company with an offer to supply the gift boxes
at a price of $.45 each. Mello concluded that the offer should be rejected on the basis of
the relevant-costing analysis in Exhibit 14–19 . International Chocolate Company’s tradi-
tional, volume-based product-costing system showed a unit product cost of $.80 per box.
However, Mello realized that not all of the costs would be avoided. She reasoned that all
of the direct material, direct labor, and variable overhead would be avoided, but only a
small part of the assigned fixed overhead would be saved. She concluded that $60,000
of supervisory salaries and $20,000 of machinery depreciation could be traced directly
to gift package production. These costs would be avoided, she felt, but the remaining

fixed costs would not. Mello concluded that only $430,000 of costs would be avoided by
purchasing, while $450,000 would be spent to buy the boxes. The decision was clear; the
supplier’s offer should be rejected.
Activity-Based Costing Analysis of the Outsourcing Decision
At a staff meeting, Mello mentioned her tentative decision to Dave Mint, the plant
controller. Mint then explained to Mello that he was completing a pilot project using
activity-based costing. Mint offered to analyze the outsourcing decision using the new
ABC database. Mello agreed, and Mint proceeded to do the ABC analysis shown in
Exhibit 14–20 .
In stage one of the ABC analysis, Mint designated 11 activity cost pools correspond-
ing to the major items in the Savannah plant’s overhead budget. These activity cost pools
were categorized as facility-level, product-sustaining level, batch-level, or unit-level
activities. In stage two of the ABC project, cost drivers were identified and pool rates
were computed. The ABC analysis showed that $243,000 of overhead should be assigned
to the gift boxes, rather than $550,000 as the conventional product-costing system had
Exhibit 14–20 indicated.

could be avoided if the boxes were purchased. Notice that none of the facility-level costs
are relevant to the analysis. They will not be avoided by purchasing the gift boxes. Mint’s
ABC analysis showed that a total of $493,000 of costs could be avoided by purchasing the
boxes at a cost of $450,000. This would result in a net saving of $43,000.
Mint showed the ABC relevant-costing analysis to Mello. After some discussion,
they agreed that various qualitative issues needed to be explored before a final decision
was made. For example, would the new supplier be reliable, and would the gift boxes be
of good quality? Nevertheless, Mello and Mint agreed that the ABC data cast an entirely
different light on the decision.
The Key Point What has happened here? Why did the conventional and ABC
analyses of this decision reach different conclusions? Is the relevant-costing concept
faulty?
The answer is no; the relevant-costing idea is alive and well. Both analyses sought
to identify the relevant costs as those that would be avoided by purchasing the gift
boxes. That approach is valid. The difference in the analyses lies in the superior ability
of the ABC data to properly identify what the avoidable costs are. This is the key point.
The conventional analysis relied on a traditional, volume-based product-costing system.
That system lumps all of the fixed overhead costs together and assigns them using a sin-
gle, unit-based cost driver (i.e., direct-labor hours). That analysis simply failed to note
that many of the so-called fixed costs are n ot really fixed with respect to the appropriate
cost driver. The more accurate ABC system correctly showed this fact, and identified
additional costs that could be avoided by purchasing.
To summarize, under activity-based costing, the concepts underlying relevant-
costing analysis remain valid. However, the ABC system does enable the decision
maker to apply the relevant-costing decision model more accurately.
Other Issues in Decision Making
Incentives for Decision Makers
In this chapter, we studied how managers should make decisions by focusing on the rel-
evant costs and benefits. In previous chapters, we covered accounting procedures for
evaluating managerial performance. There is an important link between d ecision making
and m anagerial performance evaluation. Managers typically will make decisions that
maximize their perceived performance evaluations and rewards. This is human nature. If
we want managers to make optimal decisions by properly evaluating the relevant costs
and benefits, then the performance evaluation system and reward structure had better be
consistent with that perspective.
The proper treatment of sunk costs in decision making illustrates this issue. Earlier
in this chapter, we saw that sunk costs should be ignored as irrelevant. For example, the
book value of an outdated machine is irrelevant in making an equipment-replacement
decision. Suppose, however, that a manager correctly ignores an old machine’s book
value and decides on early replacement of the machine he purchased a few years ago.
Now suppose the hapless manager is criticized by his superior for “taking a loss” on the
old machine, or for “buying a piece of junk” in the first place. What is our manager likely
to do the next time he faces a similar decision? If he is like many people, he will tend
to keep the old machine in order to justify his prior decision to purchase it. In so doing,
he will be compounding his error. However, he also may be avoiding criticism from a
superior who does not understand the importance of goal congruence.
The point is simply that if we want managers to make optimal decisions, we must
give them incentives to do so. This requires that managerial performance be judged on
the same factors that should be considered in making correct decisions.

616 Chapter 14 Decision Making: Relevant Costs and Benefits
Short-Run versus Long-Run Decisions
The decisions we have examined in this chapter were treated as short-run decisions.
Short-run decisions affect only a short time period, typically a year or less. In reality,
many of these decisions would have longer-term implications. For example, managers
usually make a decision involving the addition or deletion of a product or service with
a relatively long time frame in mind. The process of identifying relevant costs and ben-
efits is largely the same whether the decision is viewed from a short-run or long-run
perspective. One important factor that does change in a long-run analysis, however, is
the t ime value of money. When several time periods are involved in a decision, the ana-
lyst should account for the fact that a $1.00 cash flow today is different from a $1.00
cash flow in five years. A dollar received today can be invested to earn interest, while
the dollar received in five years cannot be invested over the intervening time period. The
analysis of long-run decisions requires a tool called capital budgeting, which is covered
in Chapter 16.
Pitfalls to Avoid
Identification of the relevant costs and benefits is an important step in making any eco-
nomic decision. Nonetheless, analysts often overlook relevant costs or incorrectly include
irrelevant data. In this section, we review four common mistakes to avoid in decision
making.
1. S unk costs. The book value of an asset, defined as its acquisition cost less the
accumulated depreciation, is a sunk cost. Sunk costs cannot be changed by any
current or future course of action, so they are irrelevant in decision making.
Nevertheless, a common behavioral tendency is to give undue importance to
book values in decisions that involve replacing an asset or disposing of obso-
lete inventory. People often seek to justify their past decisions by refusing to
dispose of an asset, even if a better alternative has been identified. T he moral:
Ignore sunk costs.
2. U nitized fixed costs. For product-costing purposes, fixed costs often are
divided by some activity measure and assigned to individual units of product.
The result is to make a fixed cost appear variable. While there are legitimate
reasons for this practice from a p roduct-costing perspective, it can create
havoc in decision making. Therefore, in a decision analysis, it is usually wise
to include a fixed cost in its total amount, rather than as a per-unit cost. T he
moral: Beware of unitized fixed costs in decision making.
3. Allocated fixed costs. It is also common to allocate fixed costs across divisions,
departments, or product lines. A possible result is that a product or department
may appear unprofitable when in reality it does make a contribution toward
covering fixed costs and profit. Before deciding to eliminate a department, be
sure to ask which costs will be a voided if a particular alternative is selected. A
fixed cost that has been allocated to a department may continue, in total or in
part, even after the department has been eliminated. T he moral: Beware of
allocated fixed costs; identify the avoidable costs.
4. O pportunity costs. People tend to overlook opportunity costs, or to treat such
costs as less important than out-of-pocket costs. Yet opportunity costs are just
as real and important to making a correct decision as are out-of-pocket costs.
The moral: Pay special attention to identifying and including opportunity costs
in a decision analysis.

618 Chapter 14 Decision Making: Relevant Costs and Benefits
Chapter Summary
LO1 Describe seven steps in the decision-making process and the managerial accountant’s role in
that process. The decision-making steps are: (1) clarify the decision problem; (2) specify the criterion;
(3) identify the alternatives; (4) develop a decision model; (5) collect the data; (6) select an alternative;
and (7) evaluate decision effectiveness.
LO2 Explain the relationship between quantitative and qualitative analyses in decision
making. The managerial accountant’s key role in the decision-making process is to provide data
relevant to the decision. Managers can then use these data in preparing a quantitative analysis of the
decision. Qualitative factors also are considered in making the final decision.
LO3 List and explain two criteria that must be satisfied by relevant information. In order to be
relevant to a decision, a cost or benefit must (1) bear on the future and (2) differ under the various deci-
sion alternatives.
LO4 Identify relevant costs and benefits, giving proper treatment to sunk costs, opportunity
costs, and unit costs. Sunk costs, such as the book value of equipment or inventory, are not rel-
evant to decisions. Such costs do not have any bearing on the future. Opportunity costs frequently
are relevant to decisions, but they often are overlooked by decision makers. Unit costs bear particu-
lar scrutiny in decision-making situations. Fixed costs often are unitized and assigned to products
or services for product-costing purposes. For decision-making purposes, however, unit costs can
be misleading, since the total fixed cost will not increase as the total number of units produced
increases.
LO5 Prepare analyses of various special decisions, properly identifying the relevant costs and
benefits. To analyze any special decision, the proper approach is to determine all of the costs and
benefits that will differ among the alternatives. Common decisions include the following: (1) accept
or reject a special offer; (2) outsource a product or service; and (3) add or drop a service, product, or
department.
LO6 Analyze manufacturing decisions involving joint products and limited resources. A com-
mon decision that arises in a joint-product environment is whether to sell a joint product at the split-off
point or process it further. This decision should be based on the incremental costs and benefits occurring
after the split-off point. A common decision involving limited resources is which of several products to
produce. The correct decision is to produce the product with the highest contribution margin per unit of
the scarce resource.
LO7 Explain the impact of an advanced manufacturing environment and activity-based cost-
ing on a relevant-cost analysis. The concepts underlying a relevant-cost analysis remain valid in an
advanced manufacturing environment and in situations where activity-based costing is used. However,
an ABC system typically enables a decision maker to estimate the relevant costs in a decision problem
more accurately.
LO8 Formulate a linear program to solve a product-mix problem with multiple constraints
(appendix). A linear program can be used to solve a firm’s product-mix problem when the production
process is constrained by scarce resources. A linear program consists of a linear objective function and
a set of linear constraints. The solution to the optimization problem consists of finding the optimal
solution point within the feasible region, as determined by the constraints.
Review Problem on Relevant Costs
Lansing Camera Company has received a special order for photographic equipment it does not normally
produce. The company has excess capacity, and the order could be manufactured without reducing pro-
duction of the firm’s regular products. Discuss the relevance of each of the following items in computing
the cost of the special order.
1. Equipment to be used in producing the order has a book value of $2,000. The equipment has no
other use for Lansing Camera Company . If the order is not accepted, the equipment will be sold
for $1,500. If the equipment is used in producing the order, it can be sold in three months for $800.

Chapter 14 Decision Making: Relevant Costs and Benefits 619
2. If the special order is accepted, the operation will require some of the storage space in the compa-
ny’s plant. If the space is used for this purpose, the company will rent storage space temporarily in
a nearby warehouse at a cost of $18,000. The building depreciation allocated to the storage space
to be used in producing the special order is $12,000.
3. If the special order is accepted, it will require a subassembly. Lansing Camera can purchase the
subassembly for $24 per unit from an outside supplier or make it for $30 per unit. The $30 cost
per unit was determined as follows:
Direct material .............................................................................. $10.00
Direct labor ................................................................................... 6.00
Variable overhead ......................................................................... 6.00
Allocated fixed overhead ................................................................ 8.00
Total unit cost of subassembly ....................................................... $30.00
Solution to Review Problem
1. The book value of the equipment is a sunk cost, irrelevant to the decision. The relevant cost of the
equipment is $700, determined as follows:
Sales value of equipment now .................................................................. $1,500
Sales value after producing special order ................................................... 800
Differential cost ........................................................................................ $ 700
2. The $12,000 portion of building depreciation allocated to the storage space to be used for
the special order is irrelevant. First, it is a sunk cost. Second, any costs relating to the company’s
factory building will continue whether the special order is accepted or not. The relevant cost is
the $18,000 rent that will be incurred only if the special order is accepted.
3. Lansing Camera should make the subassembly. The subassembly’s relevant cost is $22 per unit.
Relevant Cost of Making Subassembly Relevant Cost of Purchasing Subassembly
(per unit) (per unit)
Direct material ........................................... $10.00 Purchase price ........................................ $24.00
Direct labor ................................................ 6.00
Variable overhead ...................................... 6.00
Total .......................................................... $22.00
Notice that the unitized fixed overhead, $8, is not a relevant cost of the subassembly. Lansing
Camera Company’s t otal fixed cost will not change, whether the special order is accepted or not.

620 Chapter 14 Decision Making: Relevant Costs and Benefits
APPENDIX TO CHAPTER 14
Linear Programming
When a firm produces multiple products, management must decide how much of each output to pro-
Learning Objective 8 duce. In most cases, the firm is limited in the total amount it can produce, due to constraints on resources
Formulate a linear program such as machine time, direct labor, or raw materials. This situation is known as a p roduct-mix problem.
to solve a product-mix To illustrate, we will use International Chocolate Company’s Phoenix plant, which produces
problem with multiple Chewies and Chompo Bars. Exhibit 14–21 provides data pertinent to the problem.
constraints (appendix). Linear programming is a powerful mathematical tool, well suited to solving International
Chocolate Company’s product-mix problem. The steps in constructing the linear program are as follows:
1. Identify the d ecision variables, which are the variables about which a decision must be made.
International Chocolate’s decision variables are as follows:
Decision X ! Number of cases of Chewies to produce each month
variables Y ! Number of cases of Chompo Bars to produce each month
2. Write the o bjective function, which is an algebraic expression of the firm’s goal. International
Chocolate’s goal is to m aximize its total contribution margin. Since Chewies bring a contribu-
tion margin of $1 per case, and Chompos result in a contribution margin of $2 per case, the
firm’s objective function is the following:
Objective function Maximize Z ! X $ 2Y
3. Write the c onstraints, which are algebraic expressions of the limitations faced by the firm,
such as those limiting its productive resources. International Chocolate has a constraint for
machine time and a constraint for direct labor.
Machine-time constraint .02X $ .05Y & 700
Labor-time constraint .20X $ .25Y & 5,000
Suppose, for example, that management decided to produce 20,000 cases of Chewies and 6,000
cases of Chompos. The machine-time constraint would appear as follows:
(.02)(20,000) $ (.05)(6,000) ! 700
Thus, at these production levels, the machine-time constraint would just be satisfied, with no
machine hours to spare.
Graphical Solution
To understand how the linear program described above will help International Chocolate’s management
solve its product-mix problem, examine the graphs in Exhibit 14–22 . The two colored lines in panel A
represent the constraints. The colored arrows indicate that the production quantities, X and Y, must lie on
or below these lines. Since the production quantities must be nonnegative, colored arrows also appear on
the graphs’ axes. Together, the axes and constraints form an area called the f easible region, in which the
solution to the linear program must lie.
The black slanted line in panel A represents the objective function. Rearrange the objective
function equation as follows:

This form of the objective function shows that the slope of the equation is %½, which is the slope of
the objective-function line in the exhibit. Management’s goal is to maximize total contribution margin,
denoted by Z . To achieve the maximum, the objective-function line must be moved as far outward and
upward in the feasible region as possible, while maintaining the same slope. This goal is represented in
panel A by the arrow that points outward from the objective-function line.
Solution The result of moving the objective-function line as far as possible in the indicated direction
is shown in panel B of the exhibit. The objective-function line intersects the feasible region at exactly
one point, where X equals 15,000 and Y equals 8,000. Thus, International Chocolate’s optimal product
mix is 15,000 cases of Chewies and 8,000 cases of Chompos per month. The total contribution margin
is calculated as shown below.
Total contribution margin ! (15,000)($1) $ (8,000)($2) ! $31,000

solution method called the s implex algorithm. A computer can apply the algorithm to a complex linear
program and determine the solution in seconds. In addition, most linear programming computer packages
provide a sensitivity analysis of the problem. This analysis shows the decision maker the extent to which
the estimates used in the objective function and constraints can change without changing the solution.
Managerial Accountant’s Role
What is the managerial accountant’s role in International Chocolate’s product-mix decision? The pro-
duction manager in the company’s Phoenix plant makes this decision, with the help of a linear program.
However, the linear program uses i nformation supplied by the managerial accountant. The coefficients
of X and Y in the objective function are unit contribution margins. Exhibit 14–14 shows that calculating
these contribution margins requires estimates of direct-material, direct-labor, variable-overhead, and
variable selling and administrative costs. These estimates were provided by a managerial accountant,
along with estimates of the machine time and direct-labor time required to produce a case of Chewies
or Chompos. All of these estimates were obtained from the standard-costing system, upon which the
Phoenix plant’s product costs are based. Thus, the managerial accountant makes the product-mix deci-
sion possible by providing the relevant cost data.
Linear programming is widely used in business decision making. Among the applications are
blending in the petroleum and chemical industries; scheduling of personnel, railroad cars, and aircraft;
and the mixing of ingredients in the food industry. In all of these applications, managerial accountants
provide information crucial to the analysis.

Hardt has collected the following additional information related to manufacturing MTR–2000.
• Direct materials used in the production of MTR–2000 are expected to increase 8 percent
in 20x1.
• Midwest’s direct-labor contract calls for a 5 percent increase in 20x1.
• The facilities used to manufacture MTR–2000 are rented under a month-to-month rental agreement.
Thus, Midwest can withdraw from the rental agreement without any penalty. Midwest will have no
need for this space if MTR–2000 is not manufactured.
• Equipment leasing costs represent special equipment that is used in the manufacture of MTR–2000.
This lease can be terminated by paying the equivalent of one month’s lease payment for each year
left on the lease agreement. Midwest has two years left on the lease agreement, through the end of
the year 20x2.
• Forty percent of the other manufacturing overhead is considered variable. Variable overhead
changes with the number of units produced, and this rate per unit is not expected to change in 20x1.
The fixed manufacturing overhead costs are not expected to change regardless of whether
MTR–2000 is manufactured. Equipment other than the leased equipment can be used in Midwest’s
other manufacturing operations.
John Porter, divisional manager of Midwest, stopped by Hardt’s office to voice his concern regard-
ing the outsourcing of MTR–2000. Porter commented, “I am really concerned about outsourcing
MTR–2000. I have a son-in-law and a nephew, not to mention a member of our bowling team, who work
on MTR–2000. They could lose their jobs if we buy that component from Marley. I really would appre-
ciate anything you can do to make sure the cost analysis comes out right to show we should continue
making MTR–2000. Corporate is not aware of the material increases and maybe you can leave out some
of those fixed costs. I just think we should continue making MTR–2000!”
Required:
1. a. Prepare an analysis of relevant costs that shows whether or not the Midwest Division of Paibec
Corporation should make MTR–2000 or purchase it from Marley Company for 20x1.
b. Based solely on the financial results, recommend whether the 32,000 units of MTR–2000 for
20x1 should be made by Midwest or purchased from Marley.
2. Identify and briefly discuss three qualitative factors that the Midwest Division and Paibec
Corporation should consider before agreeing to purchase MTR–2000 from Marley Company .
3. By referring to the standards of ethical conduct for managerial accountants given in Chapter 1,
explain why Lynn Hardt would consider the request of John Porter to be unethical.

Fixed† ................................................................................................................................. 3.75 4.50
Total ........................................................................................................................................... $12.00 $15.00
*Variable manufacturing overhead is applied on the basis of direct-labor hours.
†Fixed manufacturing overhead is applied on the basis of machine hours.
Upstate Mechanical’s annual requirement for these components is 8,000 units of T79 and 11,000
units of B81. Recently, management decided to devote additional machine time to other product lines,
leaving only 41,000 machine hours per year for producing the bearings. An outside company has offered
to sell Upstate Mechanical its annual supply of bearings at prices of $11.25 for T79 and $13.50 for B81.
Management wants to schedule the otherwise idle 41,000 machine hours to produce bearings so that the
firm can minimize costs (maximize net benefits).
Required:
1. Compute the net benefit (loss) per machine hour that would result if Upstate Mechanical accepts
the supplier’s offer of $13.50 per unit for component B81.
2. Choose the correct answer. Upstate Mechanical will maximize its net benefits by:
a. purchasing 4,800 units of T79 and manufacturing the remaining bearings.
b. purchasing 8,000 units of T79 and manufacturing 11,000 units of B81.
c. purchasing 11,000 units of B81 and manufacturing 8,000 units of T79.
d. purchasing 4,000 units of B81 and manufacturing the remaining bearings.
e. purchasing and manufacturing some amounts other than those given above.
3. Suppose management has decided to drop product T79. Independently of requirements (1) and
(2), assume that the company’s idle capacity of 41,000 machine hours has a traceable, avoidable
annual fixed cost of $44,000, which will be incurred only if the capacity is used. Calculate the
maximum price Upstate Mechanical should pay a supplier for component B81.

completed the machine, Jay Company declared bankruptcy, defaulted on the order, and forfeited the 10
(LO 4, 5)
percent deposit paid on the selling price of $72,500.
Miami’s manufacturing manager identified the costs already incurred in the production of the 2. Contribution from sale to
special machinery for Jay Company as follows: Kaytell: $53,848
Direct material ............................................................................................................................................. $16,600

Another company, Kaytell Corporation, will buy the special machinery if it is reworked to Kaytell’s
specifications. Miami Industries offered to sell the reworked machinery to Kaytell as a special order for
$68,400. Kaytell agreed to pay the price when it takes delivery in two months. The additional identifi-
able costs to rework the machinery to Kaytell’s specifications are as follows:
Direct material ................................................................................... $ 6,200
Direct labor ........................................................................................ 4,200
Total .................................................................................................. $10,400
A second alternative available to Miami’s management is to convert the special machinery to the stan-
dard model, which sells for $62,500. The additional identifiable costs for this conversion are as follows:
Direct material ....................................................................................... $2,850
Direct labor ............................................................................................ 3,300
Total ...................................................................................................... $6,150
A third alternative for Miami Industries is to sell the machine as is for a price of $52,000. However,
the potential buyer of the unmodified machine does not want it for 60 days. This buyer has offered a
$7,000 down payment, with the remainder due upon delivery.
The following additional information is available regarding Miami’s operations.
• The sales commission rate on sales of standard models is 2 percent, while the rate on special orders
is 3 percent.
• Normal credit terms for sales of standard models are 2/10, net/30. This means that a customer
receives a 2 percent discount if payment is made within 10 days, and payment is due no later than
30 days after billing. Most customers take the 2 percent discount. Credit terms for a special order
are negotiated with the customer.

the company should accept or reject it. After examining the costs, Donato suggested to her supervi-
sor, Gerard LePenn, who is the controller, that they request competitive bids from vendors for the raw
material as the current quote seems high. LePenn insisted that the prices are in line with other vendors
and told her that she was not to discuss her observations with anyone else. Donato later discovered that
LePenn is a brother-in-law of the owner of the current raw-material supply vendor.
Required:
1. Identify and explain the costs that will be relevant to Cathy Donato’s analysis of the special order
being considered by Winner’s Circle, Inc.
2. Determine if Winner’s Circle should accept the special order. In explaining your answer, compute
both the new average unit cost and the incremental unit cost for the special order.

Sportway is a wholesale distributor supplying a wide range of moderately priced sports equipment
to large chain stores. About 60 percent of Sportway’s products are purchased from other companies
while the remainder of the products are manufactured by Sportway. The company has a Plastics Depart-
ment that is currently manufacturing molded fishing tackle boxes. Sportway is able to manufacture and
sell 8,000 tackle boxes annually, making full use of its direct-labor capacity at available work stations.
The selling price and costs associated with Sportway’s tackle boxes are as follows:
Selling price per box ..................................................................................................................... $86.00
Costs per box:
Molded plastic ........................................................................................................................ $ 8.00
Hinges, latches, handle ........................................................................................................... 9.00
Direct labor ($15.00 per hour) ................................................................................................. 18.75
Manufacturing overhead .......................................................................................................... 12.50
Selling and administrative cost ................................................................................................. 17.00 65.25
Profit per box ............................................................................................................................... $20.75
Because Sportway’s sales manager believes the firm could sell 12,000 tackle boxes if it had suffi-
cient manufacturing capacity, the company has looked into the possibility of purchasing the tackle boxes
for distribution. Maple Products, a steady supplier of quality products, would be able to provide up to
9,000 tackle boxes per year at a price of $68.00 per box delivered to Sportway’s facility.
Bo Vonderweidt, Sportway’s production manager, has come to the conclusion that the company
could make better use of its Plastics Department by manufacturing skateboards. Vonderweidt has a
market study that indicates an expanding market for skateboards and a need for additional suppliers.
Vonderweidt believes that Sportway could expect to sell 17,500 skateboards annually at a price of
$45.00 per skateboard.
After his lunch with the company president, Vonderweidt worked out the following estimates with
the assistant controller.
Selling price per skateboard ............................................................................................................. $45.00
Costs per skateboard:
Molded plastic ........................................................................................................................... $5.50
Wheels, hardware ...................................................................................................................... 7.00
Direct labor ($15.00 per hour) .................................................................................................... 7.50
Manufacturing overhead ............................................................................................................. 5.00
Selling and administrative cost .................................................................................................... 9.00 34.00
Profit per skateboard ........................................................................................................................ $11.00
In the Plastics Department, Sportway uses direct-labor hours as the application base for manufac-
turing overhead. Included in the manufacturing overhead for the current year is $50,000 of factorywide,
fixed manufacturing overhead that has been allocated to the Plastics Department. For each unit of prod-
uct that Sportway sells, regardless of whether the product has been purchased or is manufactured by
Sportway, there is an allocated $6.00 fixed overhead cost per unit for distribution that is included in the
selling and administrative cost for all products. Total selling and administrative costs for the purchased
tackle boxes would be $10.00 per unit.

Alice Carlo, the company’s president, is concerned about the results of the pricing, selling, and
production prices. After reviewing the second-quarter results, she asked her management staff to
consider the following three suggestions:
• Discontinue the R-gauge line immediately. R-gauges would not be returned to the product line
unless the problems with the gauge can be identified and resolved.
• Increase quarterly sales promotion by $100,000 on the Q-gauge product line in order to increase
sales volume by 15 percent.
• Cut production on the E-gauge line by 50 percent, and cut the traceable advertising and promotion
for this line to $20,000 each quarter.
Jason Sperry, the controller, suggested a more careful study of the financial relationships to deter-
mine the possible effects on the company’s operating results of the president’s proposed course of
action. The president agreed and assigned JoAnn Brower, the assistant controller, to prepare an analysis.
Brower has gathered the following information.
• All three gauges are manufactured with common equipment and facilities.
• The selling and administrative expense is allocated to the three gauge lines based on average sales
volume over the past three years.
• Special selling expenses (primarily advertising, promotion, and shipping) are incurred for each
gauge as follows:
Quarterly Advertising
and Promotion Shipping Expenses
Q-gauge ............................................................................... $210,000 $10 per unit
E-gauge ............................................................................... 100,000 4 per unit
R-gauge ............................................................................... 40,000 10 per unit

• The company is manufacturing at capacity and is selling all the gauges it produces.
Required:
1. JoAnn Brower says that Alberta Gauge Company’s product-line income statement for the second
quarter is not suitable for analyzing proposals and making decisions such as the ones suggested by
Alice Carlo. Write a memo to Alberta Gauge’s president that addresses the following points.
a. Explain why the product-line income statement as presented is not suitable for analysis and
decision making.
b. Describe an alternative income-statement format that would be more suitable for analysis and
decision making, and explain why it is better.
2. Use the operating data presented for Alberta Gauge Company and assume that the president’s
proposed course of action had been implemented at the beginning of the second quarter. Then
evaluate the president’s proposal by specifically responding to the following points.
a. Are each of the three suggestions cost-effective? Support your discussion with an analysis that
shows the net impact on income before taxes for each of the three suggestions.
b. Was the president correct in proposing that the R-gauge line be eliminated? Explain your
answer.
c. Was the president correct in promoting the Q-gauge line rather than the E-gauge line?
Explain your answer.
d. Does the proposed course of action make effective use of the company’s capacity?
Explain your answer.
3. Are there any qualitative factors that Alberta Gauge Company’s management should consider
before it drops the R-gauge line? Explain your answer.

FOCUS COMPANY > >>
THIS CHAPTER’S FOCUS COMPANY is Sydney
Sailing Supplies, a manufacturer of sailing sup-
plies and equipment in Sydney, Australia. One of the c ompany’s
most popular products is the Wave Darter, a two-person sail-
boat. In this chapter, we will explore a variety of issues sur-
rounding how Sydney Sailing Supplies’ management could
set a price for the Wave Darter. We also will study a pric-
ing method called target costing. Under this approach,
management determines what consumers are willing
to pay for a particular product. Then management
must find a way to produce that product at a low
enough cost to justify the price the consumers
are willing to pay.

Target Costing
and Cost Analysis
for Pricing Decisions
IN CONTRAST >>>
In contrast to the product-pricing setting explored in the first part of the
chapter, we turn our attention to competitive bidding on projects, services,
or products. In a competitive-bidding situation, two or more companies submit sealed bids
for a job, and the buyer selects from among the bids. We will explore competitive bidding
in the context of Sydney Sailing Supplies’ Marine Services Division. The company’s Marine
Services Division specializes in marina maintenance and construction, and its management
is preparing a bid to build a new marina in Sydney harbor.

AFTER COMPLETING THIS CHAPTER, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
1 List and describe the four major influences on pricing decisions.
2 Explain and use the economic, profit-maximizing pricing model.
3 Set prices using cost-plus pricing formulas.
4 Discuss the issues involved in the strategic pricing of new products.
5 List and discuss the key principles of target costing.
6 Explain the role of activity-based costing in setting a target cost.
7 Explain how product-cost distortion can undermine a firm’s pricing strategy.
8 Explain the process of value engineering and its role in target costing.
9 Determine prices using the time and material pricing approach.
10 Set prices in special-order or competitive-bidding situations by analyzing the
relevant costs.
11 Describe the legal restrictions on setting prices.
Setting the price for an organization’s product or service is one of the most important
decisions a manager faces. It is also one of the most difficult, due to the number and
variety of factors that must be considered. The pricing decision arises in virtually all
types of organizations. Manufacturers set prices for the products they manufacture;
merchandising companies set prices for their goods; service firms set prices for such
services as insurance policies, train tickets, theme park admissions, and bank loans.
Nonprofit organizations often set prices also. For example, governmental units price
vehicle registrations, park-use fees, and utility services. The optimal approach to pric-
ing often depends on the situation. Pricing a mature product or service that a firm has
sold for a long time may be quite different from pricing a new product or service.
Public utilities and TV cable companies face political considerations in pricing their
products and services, since their prices often must be approved by a governmental
commission.
In this chapter, we will study pricing decisions, with an emphasis on the role of
managerial accounting information. The setting for our discussion is Sydney Sailing
Supplies, a manufacturer of sailing supplies and equipment located in Sydney, Australia.
Major Influences on Pricing Decisions
Four major influences govern the prices set by Sydney Sailing Supplies:
1. Customer demand.
2. Actions of competitors.
3. Costs.
4. Political, legal, and image-related issues.

Customer Demand
The demands of customers are of paramount importance in all phases of business opera-

tions, from the design of a product to the setting of its price. Product-design issues and
pricing considerations are interrelated, so they must be examined simultaneously. For List and describe the four major

time and more expensive raw materials. The result almost certainly will be a higher price.
On the other hand, management must be careful not to price its product out of the market.
Discerning customer demand is a critically important and continuous process. Compa-
nies routinely obtain information from market research, such as customer surveys and
test-marketing campaigns, and through feedback from sales personnel. To be successful,
Sydney Sailing Supplies must provide the products its customers want at a price they
perceive to be appropriate.
Actions of Competitors
Although Sydney Sailing Supplies’ managers would like the company to have the sailing
market to itself, they are not so fortunate. Domestic and foreign competitors are striving
to sell their products to the same customers. Thus, as Sydney Sailing Supplies’ manage-
ment designs products and sets prices, it must keep a watchful eye on the firm’s competi-
tors. If a competitor reduces its price on sailboats of a particular type, Sydney Sailing
Supplies may have to follow suit to avoid losing its market share. Yet the company
cannot follow its competitors blindly either. Predicting competitive reactions to its
product-design and pricing strategy is a difficult but important task for Sydney Sailing
Supplies’ management.
In considering the reactions of customers and competitors, management must be
careful to properly define its product. Should Sydney Sailing Supplies’ management
define its product narrowly as sailing supplies, or more broadly as boating supplies?
For example, if the company raises the price of its two-person sailboat, will this encour-
age potential customers to switch to canoes, rowboats, and small motorboats? Or will
most potential sailboat customers react to a price increase only by price-shopping
among competing sailboat manufacturers? The way in which Sydney Sailing Supplies’
management answers these questions can profoundly affect its marketing and pricing
strategies.
Costs
The role of costs in price setting varies widely among industries. In some industries,
prices are determined almost entirely by market forces. An example is the agricul-
tural industry, where grain and meat prices are market-driven. Farmers must meet
the market price. To make a profit, they must produce at a cost below the market
price. This is not always possible, so some periods of loss inevitably result. In other
industries, managers set prices at least partially on the basis of production costs. For
example, cost-based pricing is used in the aircraft, household appliance, and gasoline
industries. Prices are set by adding a markup to production costs. Managers have
some latitude in determining the markup, so market forces influence prices as well. In
public utilities, such as electricity and natural gas companies, prices generally are set
by a regulatory agency of the state government. Production costs are of prime impor-
tance in justifying utility rates. Typically, a public utility will make a request to the
Public Utility Commission for a rate increase on the basis of its current and projected
production costs.
Balance of Market Forces and Cost-Based Pricing In most industries,
both market forces and cost considerations heavily influence prices. No organization or

industry can price its products below their production costs indefinitely. And no com-
pany’s management can set prices blindly at cost plus a markup without keeping an eye
on the market. In most cases, pricing can be viewed in either of the following ways.
How Are Prices Set?

Caterpillar
Political, Legal, and Image-Related Issues
Beyond the important effects on prices of market forces
and costs are a range of environmental considerations.
In the l egal area, managers must adhere to certain laws.
The law generally prohibits companies from discrimi-
nating among their customers in setting prices. Also
prohibited is collusion in price setting, where the major
firms in an industry all agree to set their prices at high
levels.
Political considerations also can be relevant. For
example, if the firms in an industry are perceived by
the public as reaping unfairly large profits, there may
be political pressure on legislators to tax those profits
differentially or to intervene in some way to regulate
prices.
Setting prices requires a balance between cost c onsiderations
Companies also consider their p ublic image in
and market forces. A good example is provided by the

Total Revenue, Demand, and Marginal Revenue Curves
The trade-off between a higher price and a higher sales quantity can be shown in the
shape of the firm’s total revenue curve, which graphs the relationship between total
sales revenue and quantity sold. Sydney Sailing Supplies’ total revenue curve for its two-
person sailboat, the Wave Darter, is displayed in Exhibit 15–1 , panel A. The total revenue

curve increases throughout its range, but the rate of increase declines as monthly sales
quantity increases. To see this, notice that the increase in total revenue when the sales
quantity increases from zero to a units is greater than the increase in total revenue when
the sales quantity increases from a units to b units.
Closely related to the total revenue curve are two other curves, which are graphed in
panel B of Exhibit 15–1 . The demand curve shows the relationship between the sales
price and the quantity of units demanded. The demand curve decreases throughout its
range, because any decrease in the sales price brings about an increase in the monthly
sales quantity. The demand curve is also called the average revenue curve, since it
shows the average price at which any particular quantity can be sold.
The m arginal revenue curve shows the change in total revenue that accompanies
a c hange in the quantity sold. The marginal revenue curve is decreasing throughout its
range to show that total revenue increases at a declining rate as monthly sales quantity
increases.
A tabular presentation of the price, quantity, and revenue data for Sydney Sailing
Supplies is displayed in panel C of Exhibit 15–1 . Study this table carefully to see how the
data relate to the graphs shown in panels A and B of the exhibit. No matter what approach
a manager takes to the pricing decision, a good understanding of the relationships shown
in Exhibit 15–1 will lead to better decisions. Before we can fully use the revenue data,
however, we must examine the cost side of Sydney Sailing Supplies’ business.
Total Cost and Marginal Cost Curves
Understanding cost behavior is important in many business decisions, and pricing is no
exception. How does total cost behave as the number of Wave Darters produced and sold
by Sydney Sailing Supplies changes? Panel A of Exhibit 15–2 displays the firm’s t otal
cost curve, which graphs the relationship between total cost and the quantity produced
and sold each month.1 Total cost increases throughout its range. The rate of increase in
total cost declines as quantity increases from zero to c units. To verify this, notice that
the increase in total costs when quantity increases from zero to a units is greater than the
increase in total costs when quantity increases from a units to b units.
The rate of increase in total costs increases as quantity increases from c units upward.
To verify this, notice that the increase in total costs as quantity increases from c units to
d units is less than the increase in total costs as quantity increases from d units to e units.
Closely related to the total cost curve is the marginal cost curve, which is graphed
in panel B of Exhibit 15–2 . The marginal cost curve shows the change in total cost that
accompanies a change in quantity produced and sold. Marginal cost declines as quantity
increases from zero to c units; then it increases as quantity increases beyond c units.
A tabular presentation of the cost and quantity data for Sydney Sailing Supplies is
displayed in panel C of Exhibit 15–2 . Examine this table carefully, and trace the relation-
ships between the data and the graphs shown in panels A and B of the exhibit.
Profit-Maximizing Price and Quantity
Now we have the tools we need to determine the profit-maximizing price and quantity.
In Exhibit 15–3 , we combine the revenue and cost data presented in Exhibits 15–1 and
15–2 . Sydney Sailing Supplies’ profit-maximizing sales quantity for the Wave Darter
is determined by the intersection of the marginal cost and marginal revenue curves.
(See panel B of Exhibit 15–3 .) This optimal quantity is denoted by q * on the graph.
The profit-maximizing price, denoted by p * , is determined from the demand curve for
the quantity, q * .
1 Notice that the demand and revenue curves are based on the quantity sold, while the cost curves are based on the
quantity produced. We will assume for simplicity that Sydney Sailing Supplies’ monthly sales and production
quantities are the same. This assumption tends to be true in the pleasure boat industry.

A tabular presentation of the revenue, cost, and profit data is shown in panel C of
Exhibit 15–3 . Notice that monthly profit is maximized when the price is set at $925 and
40 Wave Darters are produced and sold each month.
Price Elasticity
The impact of price changes on sales volume is called the p rice elasticity. Demand is
elastic if a price increase has a large negative impact on sales volume, and vice versa.
Demand is i nelastic if price changes have little or no impact on sales quantity. C ross-
elasticity refers to the extent to which a change in a product’s price affects the demand
for other substitute products. For example, if Sydney Sailing Supplies raises the price of
its two-person sailboat, there may be an increase in demand for substitute recreational
craft, such as small powerboats, canoes, or windsurfers.
Measuring price elasticity and cross-elasticity is an important objective of market
research. Having a good understanding of these economic concepts helps managers to
determine the profit-maximizing price.
Limitations of the Profit-Maximizing Model
The economic model of the pricing decision serves as a useful framework for approach-
ing a pricing problem. However, it does have several limitations. First, the firm’s demand
and marginal revenue curves are difficult to discern with precision. Although market
research is designed to gather data about product demand, it rarely enables management
to predict completely the effects of price changes on the quantity demanded. Many other
factors affect product demand in addition to price. Product design and quality, advertising
and promotion, and company reputation also significantly influence consumer demand
for a product.
Second, the marginal-revenue, marginal-cost paradigm is not valid for all forms of
market organization. In an o ligopolistic market, where a small number of sellers com-
pete among themselves, the simple economic pricing model is no longer appropriate. In
an oligopoly, such as the automobile industry, the reactions of competitors to a firm’s
pricing policies must be taken into account. While economists have studied oligopolistic
pricing, the state of the theory is not sufficient to provide a thorough understanding of the
impact of prices on demand.
The third limitation of the economic pricing model involves the difficulty of measur-
ing marginal cost. Cost accounting systems are not designed to measure the marginal
changes in cost incurred as production and sales increase unit by unit. To measure mar-
ginal costs would entail a very costly information system. Most managers believe that
any improvements in pricing decisions made possible by marginal-cost data would not be
sufficient to defray the cost of obtaining the information.
Costs and Benefits of Information
Managerial accountants always face a cost-benefit trade-off in the production of cost
information for pricing and other decisions. As Exhibit 15–4 shows, only a sophisticated
information system can collect marginal-cost data. However, such information is more
costly to obtain. The result is that the optimal approach to pricing and other decisions is
likely to lie in between the extremes shown in Exhibit 15–4 . For this reason, most man-
agers make pricing decisions based on a combination of economic considerations and
accounting product-cost information.
In spite of its limitations, the marginal-revenue, marginal-cost paradigm of pricing
serves as a useful conceptual framework for the pricing decision. Within this overall
framework, managers typically rely heavily on a cost-based pricing approach, as we shall
see next.

Role of Accounting Product Costs in Pricing
Most managers base prices on accounting product costs, at least to some extent. There
“Today we spend more are several reasons for this. First, most companies sell many products or services. There
of our time analyzing and simply is not enough time to do a thorough demand and marginal-cost analysis for every
understanding . . . our product or service. Managers must rely on a quick and straightforward method for setting
margins, understanding our prices, and cost-based pricing formulas provide it. Second, even though market consider-
prices, understanding the ations ultimately may determine the final product price, a cost-based pricing formula gives
markets in which we do the manager a place to start. Finally, and most importantly, the cost of a product or service

Caterpillar may be “given away” initially, at a price below cost, a product’s price ultimately must
cover its costs in order for the firm to remain in business. Even a nonprofit organization,
unless it is heavily subsidized, cannot forever price products or services below their costs.
Cost-Plus Pricing
Cost-based pricing formulas typically have the following general form.
Learning Objective 3
Price ! Cost " (Markup percentage # Cost)
Set prices using cost-plus
pricing formulas. Such a pricing approach often is called cost-plus pricing, because the price is equal to
cost plus a markup. Depending on how cost is defined, the markup percentage may differ.
Several different definitions of cost, each combined with a different markup percentage,
can result in the same price for a product or service.
Exhibit 15–5 illustrates how Sydney Sailing Supplies’ management could use several
different cost-plus pricing formulas and arrive at a price of $925 for the Wave Darter.
Cost-plus formula (1) is based on variable manufacturing cost. Formula (2) is based on
absorption (or full) manufacturing cost, which includes an allocated portion of fixed
manufacturing costs. Formula (3) is based on all costs: both variable and fixed costs of
the manufacturing, selling, and administrative functions. Formula (4) is based on all vari-
able costs, including variable manufacturing, selling, and administrative costs. Notice
that all four pricing formulas are based on a linear representation of the cost function, in
which all costs are categorized as fixed or variable.
As Sydney Sailing Supplies includes more costs in the cost base of the pricing for-
mula, the required markup percentage declines. This reflects the fact that, one way or
another, the price must cover all costs as well as a normal profit margin. If only variable
manufacturing costs are included explicitly in the cost base, as in formula (1), then all of
the other costs (and the firm’s profit) must be covered by the markup. However, if the cost
base used in the pricing formula includes all costs, as in formula (3), the markup can be
much lower, since it need cover only the firm’s normal profit margin.

Exhibit 15–5
A company typically uses only one of the four cost-plus pricing formulas illustrated Alternative Cost-Plus
Pricing Formulas
in Exhibit 15–5 . Which formula is best? Let’s examine the advantages and disadvantages
of each approach.
Absorption-Cost Pricing Formulas
Most companies that use cost-plus pricing use either absorption manufacturing cost
or total cost as the basis for pricing products or services. [See formulas (2) and (3) in
Exhibit 15–5 .] The reasons generally given for this tendency are as follows:
1. In the long run, the price must cover all costs and a normal profit margin. Basing
the cost-plus formula on only variable costs could encourage managers to set too
low a price in order to boost sales. This will not happen if managers understand
that a variable cost-plus pricing formula requires a higher markup to cover fixed
costs and profit. Nevertheless, many managers argue that people tend to view the
cost base in a cost-plus pricing formula as the floor for setting prices. If prices
are set too close to variable manufacturing cost, the firm will fail to cover its
fixed costs. Ultimately, such a practice could result in the failure of the business.
2. Absorption-cost or total-cost pricing formulas provide a justifiable price that
tends to be perceived as equitable by all parties. Consumers generally understand
that a company must make a profit on its product or service in order to remain in
business. Justifying a price as the total cost of production, sales, and administra-
tive activities, plus a reasonable profit margin, seems reasonable to buyers.
3. When a company’s competitors have similar operations and cost structures,
cost-plus pricing based on full costs gives management an idea of how com-
petitors may set prices.
4. Absorption-cost information is provided by a firm’s cost accounting system,
because it is required for external financial reporting under generally accepted

accounting principles. Since absorption-cost information already exists, it is
cost-effective to use it for pricing. The alternative would involve preparing
special product-cost data specifically for the pricing decision. In a firm with
hundreds of products, such data could be expensive to produce.
The primary disadvantage of absorption-cost or total-cost pricing formulas is that
“An indemnity [insurance] they obscure the cost behavior pattern of the firm. Since absorption-cost and total-cost

Variable-Cost Pricing Formulas
BlueCross BlueShield
of North Carolina To avoid blurring the effects of cost behavior on profit, some managers prefer to use cost-
plus pricing formulas based on either variable manufacturing costs or total variable costs.
[See formulas (1) and (4) in Exhibit 15–5 .] Three advantages are attributed to this pricing
approach:
1. Variable-cost data do not obscure the cost behavior pattern by unitizing fixed
costs and making them appear variable. Thus, variable-cost information is more
consistent with cost-volume-profit analysis often used by managers to see the
profit implications of changes in price and volume.
2. Variable-cost data do not require allocation of common fixed costs to individual
product lines. For example, the annual salary of Sydney Sailing Supplies’ vice
president of sales is a cost that must be borne by all of the company’s product
lines. Arbitrarily allocating a portion of her salary to the Wave Darter product
line is not meaningful.
3. Variable-cost data are exactly the type of information managers need when
facing certain decisions, such as whether to accept a special order. This
decision, examined in detail in the preceding chapter, often requires an analysis
that separates fixed and variable costs.
The primary disadvantage of the variable-cost pricing formula was described earlier.
If managers perceive the variable cost of a product or service as the floor for the price,
they may tend to set the price too low for the firm to cover its fixed costs. Eventually
this can spell disaster. Therefore, if variable-cost data are used as the basis for cost-plus
pricing, managers must understand the need for higher markups to ensure that all costs
are covered.
Determining the Markup
Regardless of which cost-plus formula is used, Sydney Sailing Supplies must determine
its markup on the Wave Darter. If management uses a variable-cost pricing formula,
the markup must cover all fixed costs and a reasonable profit. If management uses
an absorption-costing formula, the markup still must be sufficient to cover the firm’s
profit on the Wave Darter product line. What constitutes a reasonable or normal profit
margin?
Return-on-Investment Pricing A common approach to determining the profit
margin in cost-plus pricing is to base profit on the firm’s target return on investment
(ROI). To illustrate r eturn-on-investment pricing, suppose Sydney Sailing Supplies’
production plan calls for 480 Wave Darters to be manufactured during the year. Based
on the cost data shown in Exhibit 15–5 , this production plan will result in the following
total costs.

Suppose the year’s average amount of capital invested in the Wave Darter product
line is $300,000. If Sydney Sailing Supplies’ target return on investment for the Wave
Darter line is 20 percent, the required annual profit is computed as follows:
Average invested capital # Target ROI ! Target profit
$300,000 # 20% ! $60,000
The markup percentage required to earn Sydney Sailing Supplies a $60,000 profit on
the Wave Darter line depends on the cost-plus formula used. We will compute the markup
percentage for two cost-plus formulas.
1. C ost-plus pricing based on total costs. The total cost of a Wave Darter
is $800 per unit ( Exhibit 15–5 ). To earn a profit of $60,000 on annual
sales of 480 sailboats, the company must make a profit of $125 per boat
($125 ! $60,000 $ 480). This entails a markup percentage of 15.63 percent
above total cost of $800.
15.63% !

A shortcut to the same conclusion uses the following formula.

2. Cost-plus pricing based on total variable costs. The total variable cost of a Wave
Darter is $450 per unit ( Exhibit 15–5 ). The markup percentage applied to variable
cost must be sufficient to cover both annual profit of $60,000 and total annual
fixed costs of $168,000. The required markup percentage is computed as follows:
Markup percentage Target profit " Total annual fixed cost

A ccounting PRICE COMPETITION AND COST MANAGEMENT
P ractice Intense price competition, sometimes referred to as a price war, can occur in just about
any industry. BusinessWeek reports that the auto insurance industry is entering such a

period of price competition. Allstate and S tate Farm Mutual are among the insurance carri-
Mutual, General Motors,
ers being forced to lower their rates. In order to survive in a price war, though, a company
and Toyota
must aggressively manage its costs. Allstate, for example, is making greater use of its
customer database to determine which drivers are the best risks for lowered premiums
and which drivers should continue to pay premiums at or near the current levels. 2
Price competition is always intense in the auto industry. According to The Wall
Street Journal, “In an attempt to rewrite pricing rules in the highly competitive U.S. auto
market, General Motors will slash the price on most of its new vehicles. The move is the
auto maker’s latest attempt to settle on a pricing strategy that is both profitable for the
company and compelling for customers.” In order to cut prices, though, GM will have to
aggressively manage its production costs. 3
T oyota ’s response to increased price competition is an aggressive cost-cutting
campaign. In recent years, Toyota has reduced its procurement costs by nearly a third.
The auto maker’s next move is to reduce the average “number of steel parts in cars from
610 to 500 to deal with the soaring cost of steel.” 4
Meeting competitive prices and effectively managing costs go hand in hand in any
business.
Cost-Plus Pricing: Summary and Evaluation2 34
We have examined two different approaches to setting prices: (1) the economic, profit-
maximizing approach and (2) cost-plus pricing. Although the techniques involved in
these methods are quite different, the methods complement each other. In setting prices,
managers cannot ignore the market, nor can they ignore costs. Cost-plus pricing is used
widely in practice to establish a starting point in the process of determining a price. Cost-
plus formulas are simple; they can be applied mechanically without taking the time of top
management. They make it possible for a company with hundreds of products or services
to cope with the tasks of updating prices for existing products and setting initial prices
for new products.
Cost-plus pricing formulas can be used effectively with a variety of cost definitions,
but the markup percentage must be appropriate for the type of cost used. It is imperative
that price-setting managers understand that ultimately the price must cover all costs and
a normal profit margin. Absorption-cost-plus or total-cost-plus pricing has the advantage
of keeping the manager’s attention focused on covering total costs. The variable-cost-plus
formulas have the advantage of not obscuring important information about cost behavior.
Cost-plus pricing formulas establish a starting point in setting prices. Then the
price setter must weigh market conditions, likely actions of competitors, and general
business conditions. Thus, effective price setting requires a constant interplay of market
considerations and cost awareness.

Strategic Pricing of New Products
Pricing a new product is an especially challenging decision problem. The newer the con-

new technology. Genetic engineering, superconductivity, artificial hearts, and space- products.
grown crystals are all examples of such frontier technologies.
Pricing a new product is harder than pricing a mature product because of the magni-
tude of the uncertainties involved. New products entail many uncertainties. For example,
what obstacles will be encountered in manufacturing the product, and what will be the
costs of production? Moreover, after the product is available, will anyone want to buy it,
and at what price? If Sydney Sailing Supplies decides to market a new two-person sail-
boat, management can make a good estimate of both the production costs and the poten-
tial market for the product. The uncertainties here are far smaller than the uncertainties
facing a company developing artificial hearts.
In addition to the production and demand uncertainties, new products pose another
sort of challenge. There are two widely differing strategies that a manufacturer of a new
product can adopt. One strategy is called skimming pricing, in which the initial product
price is set high, and short-term profits are reaped on the new product. The initial market
will be small, due in part to the high initial price. This pricing approach often is used for
unique products, where there are people who “must have it” whatever the price. As the
product gains acceptance and its appeal broadens, the price is lowered gradually. Eventu-
ally the product is priced in a range that appeals to several kinds of buyers. An example of
a product for which skimming pricing was used is the high-definition television. Initially
HDTVs were priced quite high and were affordable by only a few buyers. Eventually the
price was lowered, and HDTVs were purchased by a wide range of consumers.
An alternative initial pricing strategy is called penetration pricing, in which the
initial price is set relatively low. By setting a low price for a new product, management “HMOs go to the market-

with an acceptable profit margin. Finally, engineers and cost analysts work together to
design a product that can be manufactured for the allowable cost. This process, called
target costing, is used widely by companies in the development stages of new products.
A new product’s t arget cost is the projected long-run cost that will enable a firm to
enter and remain in the market for the product and compete successfully with the firm’s
competitors.

A ccounting PRICING ON THE INTERNET BY “E-TAILERS”
P ractice One of the most difficult issues in building an online retail business has proven to be pric-
ing. “Many Internet merchants are still struggling to find ways to set prices to attract as
Amazon.com
many customers as possible, while fattening up their razor-thin profit margins. What these
retailers do know is what h asn’t worked.”
As the dot-com industry struggles, flawed pricing strategies have taken much of the
blame. “Too many merchants raced for the bottom with deep discounts that made prof-
its all but impossible to achieve—especially when the stock market bottomed out and
funding for dot-coms froze. Others have felt the consumer backlash to so-called price
discrimination, as the Internet has given shoppers the ability to better detect price dis-
crepancies and bargains. The survivors must now figure out if it is even possible to take
advantage of the Internet’s unique capabilities to set dynamic prices, which would bet-
ter reflect a customer’s willingness to pay more under different circumstances. ‘Before
the Internet existed, retail was a very competitive, difficult, low-margin business,’ says
economist Austan Goolsbee. ‘With the advent of Internet retailers, there was a brief
moment in which they and others believed they had broken the iron chain of low margins
and high competition in retail by introducing the Internet. Now, retail online is starting to
look like retail offline—very competitive, with squeezed profit margins. In all, a very tough
place to be.’
Pricing on the Internet “was expected to offer retailers a number of advantages.”
First, “it would be far easier to raise or lower prices in response to demand, without
the need of a clerk running through a store with a pricing gun. Online prices could be
changed in far smaller increments—even by just a penny or two—as frequently as a
merchant desired, making it possible to fine-tune pricing strategies.”
The real payoff, though, “was supposed to be better information on exactly how
price-conscious customers are. For instance, knowing that customer A doesn’t care
whether the ‘Gladiator’ DVD in her shopping basket costs $21.95 or $25.95 would leave
an enterprising merchant free to charge the higher price on the spot. By contrast, know-
ing that customer B is going to put author John Le Carre’s latest thriller back on the shelf
unless it’s priced at $20, instead of $28, would open an opportunity for a bookseller to
make the sale by cutting the price in real time.” However, putting this concept “into prac-
tice online has turned out to be exceptionally difficult, in part because the Internet also
has empowered consumers to compare prices to find out if other merchants are offering
a better deal or if other consumers are getting a bigger break.” It has also made it easier
for consumers to register a complaint. For example, “ Amazon.com raised a furor . . . when
customers learned they were paying different prices for the same DVD movies, the result
of a marketing test in which the retailer varied prices to gauge the effect on demand.”
After receiving many complaints from irate consumers, “Amazon announced it would
refund the difference between the highest and lowest prices in the test.”5
A Strategic Profit and Cost Management Process
Target costing can be a critical tool for management as it seeks to strategically manage
the company’s costs and profits. By ensuring that products are designed so that they can
be produced at a low enough cost to be priced competitively, management can achieve
and maintain a sustainable competitive position in the market. 5

Chapter 15 Target Costing and Cost Analysis for Pricing Decisions 659
Key Principles of Target Costing Target costing involves seven key principles.6
• Price-led costing. Target costing sets the target cost by f irst determining the
price at which a product can be sold in the marketplace. Subtracting the target
profit margin from this t arget price yields the target cost, that is, the cost at
which the product must be manufactured. This simple, but strategically
important, relationship can be expressed in the following equation.
Target cost ! Target price % Target profit
Notice that in a target costing approach, the price is set first, and t hen the
target product cost is determined. This is opposite from the order in which
the product cost and selling price are determined under traditional cost-plus
pricing.
• F ocus on the customer. To be successful at target costing, management must
listen to the company’s customers. What products do they want? What features
are important? How much are they willing to pay for a certain level of product
quality? Management needs to aggressively seek customer feedback, and then
products must be designed to satisfy customer demand and be sold at a price they
are willing to pay. In short, the target costing approach is market driven.
• F ocus on product design. Design engineering is a key element in target cost-
ing. Engineers must design a product from the ground up so that it can be
produced at its target cost. This design activity includes specifying the raw
materials and components to be used as well as the labor, machinery, and other
elements of the production process. In short, a product must be designed for
manufacturability.
• F ocus on process design. As indicated in the preceding point, every aspect of the
production process must be examined to make sure that the product is produced
as efficiently as possible. The use of touch labor, technology, global sourcing in
procurement, and every aspect of the production process must be designed with
the product’s target cost in mind.
• Cross-functional teams. Manufacturing a product at or below its target cost
requires the involvement of people from many different functions in an orga- “Target costing is neither

engineering, production scheduling, material handling, and cost management. (15e)
Individuals from all these diverse areas of expertise can make key contributions U.S. Navy Acquisition
to the target costing process. Moreover, “a cross-functional team is not a set of Center
specialists who contribute their expertise and then leave; they are responsible for
the entire product.”7
• Life-cycle costs. In specifying a product’s target cost, analysts must be careful to
incorporate all of the product’s l ife-cycle costs. These include the costs of prod- “Target costing with sup-

and complex products. Yet a traditional product-costing system, in which all overhead
is assigned on the basis of a single unit-level activity like direct-labor hours, fails to
capture the cost implications of product diversity. In contrast, an activity-based costing
(ABC) system does measure the extent to which each product line drives costs in the key
production-support activities.
Managers should be aware that cost distortion can result in overpricing high-
volume and relatively simple products, while low-volume and complex products are
undercosted. This can undermine any effort to set prices competitively, even under the
target-costing approach. The competitive implications of such strategic pricing errors
can be disastrous.1 1

Japanese companies.” 12 In recent years, however, many other companies, including
C aterpillar, C hrysler, B oeing, and K odak, have made significant contributions to tar-
get costing theory and practice.
I suzu Motors, Ltd. is a leading Japanese manufacturer of automobiles, buses, and
both light- and heavy-duty trucks. “At Isuzu, value engineering (VE) has been developed
to cover all stages of product design and manufacture. Indeed, three different stages of
VE—zeroth, first, and second ‘looks’—are used in the design phase to increase the func-
tionality of new products.”1 3
• Zeroth look VE is applied at the earliest stages of new product design—“the
concept proposal stage, when the basic concept of the product is developed
and its preliminary quality, cost, and investment targets are established.”
• First look VE is applied during the last half of the concept proposal stage and
throughout the product planning phase. During this stage, a product’s quality,
functionality, and selling price are determined; a design plan is submitted;
and target costs are determined for each of the new vehicle’s major functions
(e.g., engine and transmission). Also, the degree of component commonality is
set. “First look VE is used at this stage to increase the value of the product by
increasing its functionality without increasing its cost.”
• Second look VE is applied during the last half of the product planning stage and
the first half of the product development and preparation stage. “The compo-
nents of the vehicle’s major functions are identified, and hand-made prototypes
are assembled. At this stage, VE works to improve the value and functionality of
existing components, not to create new ones.”
In addition, various t ear-down methods are used by Isuzu, and many other companies, “to
analyze competitive products in terms of materials they contain, parts they use, ways they
function, and ways they are manufactured.” At Isuzu, for example, dynamic tear-down
focuses on reducing the number of vehicle assembly operations or the time required to
perform them. C ost tear-down examines ways to reduce the cost of the components used

includes the direct cost of the materials used in a job plus a charge for material handling
and storage. Time and material pricing is used widely by construction companies, print-
ers, repair shops, and professional firms, such as engineering, law, and public account-
ing firms.
To illustrate, we will examine a special job undertaken by Sydney Sailing Supplies.
The company’s vice president for sales, Richard Moby, was approached by a successful
local physician about refurbishing her yacht. She wanted an engine overhaul, complete
refurbishment and redecoration of the cabin facilities, and stripping and repainting of the
hull and deck. The work would be done in the Repair Department of the company’s Yacht
Division, located in Melbourne, Australia.
Data regarding the operations of the Repair Department are as follows:
Labor rate, including fringe benefits ......................................................................................................... $18.00 per hour
Hourly charge to cover profit margin ......................................................................................................... $7.00 per hour
Annual labor hours .................................................................................................................................. 10,000 hours
Annual overhead costs:
Material handling and storage ............................................................................................................. $40,000
Other overhead costs (supervision, utilities, insurance, and depreciation) ................................................ $200,000
Annual cost of materials used in Repair Department .................................................................................. $1,000,000
Based on these data, the Repair Department computed its time and material prices
as follows:

The effect of the material-charge formula is to include a charge for the costs incurred
in the handling and storage of materials.
Richard Moby estimates that the yacht refurbishment job will require 200 hours of
labor and $8,000 in materials. Moby’s price quotation for the job is shown in the Excel
spreadsheet in Exhibit 15–7 .
Included in the $17,320 price quotation for the yacht refurbishment are charges for
labor costs, overhead, material costs, material handling and storage costs, and a normal
profit margin. Some companies also charge an additional markup on the materials used

in a job in order to earn a profit on that component of their services. Sydney Sailing
Supplies’ practice is to charge a high enough profit charge on its labor to earn an appro-
priate profit for the Repair Department.
Competitive Bidding
In a competitive bidding situation, two or more companies submit sealed bids (or
Learning Objective 10
prices) for a project, service, or product to a potential buyer. The buyer selects one of
Set prices in special-order or the companies for the job on the basis of the bid price and the design specifications for
competitive-bidding situations the job. Competitive bidding complicates a manager’s pricing problem, because now the
by analyzing the relevant costs. manager is in direct competition with one or more competitors. If all of the companies
submitting bids offer a roughly equivalent product or service, the bid price becomes the
sole criterion for selecting the contractor. The higher the price that is bid, the greater
will be the profit on the job, if the firm gets the contract. However, a higher price also
lowers the probability of obtaining the contract to perform the job. Thus, there is a
trade-off between bidding high, to make a good profit, and bidding low, to land the
contract. Some say there is a “winner’s curse” in competitive bidding, meaning that the
company bidding low enough to beat out its competitors probably bid too low to make
an acceptable profit on the job. Despite the winner’s curse, competitive bidding is a
common form of selecting contractors in many types of business.
Richard Moby was approached recently by the city of Sydney about building a new
marina for moderate-sized sailing vessels. Moby decided that his company’s Marine Ser-
vices Division should submit a bid on the job. The Marine Services Division specializes
in marina maintenance and construction. The city announced that three other firms also
would be submitting bids. Since all four companies were equally capable of building the
marina to the city’s specifications, Moby assumed that the bid price would be the deciding
factor in selecting the contractor.
Moby consulted with the controller and chief engineer of the Marine Services
Division, and the following data were compiled.

1,500 direct-labor hours at $8.00 per hour .......................................................................................................... 12,000
Estimated total cost ............................................................................................................................................. $67,500
The Marine Services Division allocates variable-overhead costs to jobs on the basis
of direct-labor hours. These costs consist of indirect-labor costs, such as the wages of
equipment-repair personnel, gasoline and lubricants, and incidental supplies such as
rope, chains, and drill bits. Fixed-overhead costs, also allocated to jobs on the basis of
direct-labor hours, include such costs as workers’compensation insurance, depreciation
on vehicles and construction equipment, depreciation of the division’s buildings, and
supervisory salaries.
It was up to Richard Moby to decide on the bid price for the marina. In his meet-
ing with the divisional controller and the chief engineer, Moby argued that the marina
job was important to the company for two reasons. First, the Marine Services Division
had been operating well below capacity for several months. The marina job would not
preclude the firm from taking on any other construction work, so it would not entail an
opportunity cost. Second, the marina job would be good advertising for Sydney Sail-
ing Supplies. City residents would see the firm’s name on the project, and this would
promote sales of the company’s boats and sailing supplies.
Based on these arguments, Moby pressed for a bid price that just covered the firm’s
variable costs and allowed for a modest contribution margin. The chief engineer was
obstinate, however, and argued for a higher bid price that would give the division a good
profit on the job. “My employees work hard to do an outstanding job, and their work is
worth a premium to the city,” was the engineer’s final comment on the issue. After the
threesome tossed the problem around all morning, the controller agreed with Moby. A
bid price of $60,000 was finally agreed upon.
This is a typical approach to setting prices for special jobs and competitively bid con-
tracts. When a firm has excess capacity, a price that covers the incremental costs incurred
because of the job will contribute toward covering the company’s fixed cost and profit.
None of the Marine Services Division’s fixed costs will increase as a result of taking on
the marina job. Thus, a bid price of $60,000 will cover the $55,500 of variable costs on
the job and contribute $4,500 toward covering the division’s fixed costs.
Bid price ............................................................................................................................................................. $60,000
Variable costs of marina job (incremental costs incurred only if job is done) ............................................................ 55,500
Contribution from marina job (contribution to covering the division’s fixed costs) ..................................................... $ 4,500
Naturally, Sydney Sailing Supplies’ management would like to make a larger profit on
the marina job, but bidding a higher price means running a substantial risk of losing the
job to a competitor.
No Excess Capacity What if the Marine Services Division has no excess
capacity? If management expects to have enough work to fully occupy the division, a dif-
ferent approach is appropriate in setting the bid price. The fixed costs of the division are
capacity-producing costs, which are costs incurred in order to create productive capacity.
Depreciation of buildings and equipment, supervisory salaries, insurance, and property
taxes are examples of fixed costs incurred to give a company the capacity to carry on its
operations. When such costs are allocated to individual jobs, the cost of each job reflects
an estimate of the opportunity cost of using limited capacity to do that particular job. For
this reasoning to be valid, however, the organization must be at full capacity. If there is
excess capacity, there is no opportunity cost in using that excess capacity.

================================================================================
PAGE 701
================================================================================

666 Chapter 15 Target Costing and Cost Analysis for Pricing Decisions
If the Marine Services Division has no excess capacity, it would be appropriate to
focus on the estimated full cost of the marina job, $67,500, which includes an allocation
of the division’s fixed capacity-producing costs. Now Richard Moby might legitimately
argue for a bid price in excess of $67,500. If the division is awarded the marina contract
by the city, a price above $67,500 will cover all the costs of the job and make a contribu-
tion toward the division’s profit.
However, as Richard Moby pointed out, there will be valuable promotional benefits
to Sydney Sailing Supplies if its Marine Services Division builds the marina. This is a
qualitative factor, because these potential benefits are difficult to quantify. Moby will
have to make a judgment regarding just how important the marina job is to the company.
The greater the perceived qualitative benefits, the lower the bid price should be set to
maximize the likelihood that the company will be awarded the contract.
Summary of Competitive-Bidding Analysis The Marine Services Division’s
pricing problem is summarized in Exhibit 15–8 . As you can see, the final pricing decision
requires managerial judgment to fully consider the quantitative cost data, the qualitative
promotional benefits, and the trade-off between a higher profit and a greater likelihood of
getting the marina contract.
Accept or Reject a Special Order In the preceding chapter, we examined
in detail the decision as to whether a special order should be accepted or rejected. The
analysis focused on identifying the relevant costs of the special order. The existence of
excess capacity was an important factor in that analysis. Accepting a special order when
excess capacity exists entails no opportunity cost. But when there is no excess capacity,
one relevant cost of accepting a special order is the opportunity cost incurred by using the
firm’s limited capacity for the special order instead of some other job. After all relevant
costs of the order have been identified, the decision maker compares the total relevant
cost of the order with the price offered. If the price exceeds the relevant cost, the order
generally should be accepted.
The decision is conceptually very similar to the bid-pricing problem discussed in
this chapter. Setting a price for a special order or competitive bid also entails an analysis
of the relevant costs of the job. Whether the decision maker is setting a price or has been
offered a price, he or she must identify the relevant costs of providing the product or
service requested.
Effect of Antitrust Laws on Pricing
Companies are not free to set any price they wish for their products or services. U.S.
Learning Objective 11
antitrust laws, including the Robinson-Patman Act, the Clayton Act, and the Sherman
Describe the legal restrictions Act, restrict certain types of pricing behavior. These laws prohibit p rice discrimination,
on setting prices. which means quoting different prices to different customers for the same product or
service. Such price differences are unlawful unless they can be clearly justified by differ-
ences in the costs incurred to produce, sell, or deliver the product or service. Managers
should keep careful records justifying such cost differences when they exist, because the
records may be vital to a legal defense if price differences are challenged in court.
Another pricing practice prohibited by law is predatory pricing. This practice
involves temporarily cutting a price to broaden demand for a product with the intention of
later restricting the supply and raising the price again. In determining whether a price is
predatory, the courts examine a business’s cost records. If the product is sold below cost,
the pricing is deemed to be predatory. The laws and court cases are ambiguous as to the
appropriate definition of cost. However, various court decisions make it harder to prove
predatory pricing. Nevertheless, this is one area where a price-setting decision maker is
well advised to have an accountant on the left and a lawyer on the right before setting
prices that could be deemed predatory.

Chapter Summary
LO1 List and describe the four major influences on pricing decisions. Many influences affect
pricing decisions. Chief among these are: customer demand; the actions of competitors; the costs of the
products or services; and political, legal, and image-related issues.
LO2 Explain and use the economic, profit-maximizing pricing model. Under this approach to
pricing, the profit-maximizing quantity is determined by the intersection of the marginal revenue and
marginal cost curves. At this optimal sales quantity level, the profit-maximizing price is determined
from the demand (or average-revenue) curve.
LO3 Set prices using cost-plus pricing formulas. Cost-plus pricing formulas are commonly based
on four product-cost measures: (1) variable manufacturing cost; (2) absorption manufacturing cost;
(3) total cost; and (4) total variable cost. Markups often are set to earn the company a target profit on its
products, based on a target rate of return on investment.
LO4 Discuss the issues involved in the strategic pricing of new products. Strategic pricing of new
products is an especially challenging problem for management. Various pricing approaches, such as
skimming pricing or penetration pricing, may be appropriate depending on the product.

668 Chapter 15 Target Costing and Cost Analysis for Pricing Decisions
LO5 List and discuss the key principles of target costing. Target costing often is used to design a
new product that can be produced at a cost that will enable the firm to sell it at a competitive price. Value
engineering and activity-based costing are valuable tools used in the target costing process.
LO6 Explain the role of activity-based costing in setting a target cost. Activity-based costing helps
to avoid product cost distortion, in which relatively high-volume and relatively simple products tend to
be overcosted by traditional product-costing systems, and relatively low-volume and relatively complex
products tend to be undercosted.
LO7 Explain how product-cost distortion can undermine a firm’s pricing strategy. Product-cost
distortion occurs when relatively high-volume and relatively simple products tend to be overcosted by
traditional product-costing systems, and relatively low-volume and relatively complex products tend to
be undercosted. This phenomenon can lead a company to lose sales by overpricing certain products and
lose profit by selling other products at too low a price.
LO8 Explain the process of value engineering and its role in target costing. Value engineering
analyzes a product’s design and production process to identify areas for cost reduction and process
improvement. By reducing a product’s cost, management can bring a product’s production cost down to
meet its target cost.
LO9 Determine prices using the time and material pricing approach. In industries such as con-
struction, repair, printing, and professional services, time and material pricing often is used. Under this
approach, the price is determined as the sum of a labor-cost component and a material-cost component.
Either or both of these components may include a markup to ensure that the company earns a profit on
its services.
LO10 Set prices in special-order or competitive-bidding situations by analyzing the relevant
costs. Pricing special orders and determining competitive bid prices entail an analysis of the relevant
costs to be incurred in completing the job. The relevant-cost analysis should incorporate the existence of
excess capacity or the lack of it.
LO11 Describe the legal restrictions on setting prices. The law prohibits price discrimination, which
means quoting different prices to different customers for the same product or service. Also outlawed is
predatory pricing, which involves temporarily cutting a price to broaden demand for a product with the
intention of later restricting the supply and raising the price again.
Review Problem on Cost-Plus Pricing
Kitchenware Corporation manufactures high-quality copper pots and pans. Greta Cooke, one of the
company’s price analysts, is involved in setting a price for the company’s new Starter Set. This set
consists of seven of the most commonly used pots and pans. During the next year, the company plans to
produce 10,000 Starter Sets, and the controller has provided Cooke with the following cost data.
Predicted Costs of 10,000 Starter Sets
Direct material per set .......................................................................................................... $60
Direct labor per set, 2 hours at $10.00 per hr ........................................................................ 20
Variable selling cost per set .................................................................................................. 5
Total .................................................................................................................................... $85
Variable-overhead rate ......................................................................................................... $ 8.00 per direct-labor hour
Fixed-overhead rate ............................................................................................................. $12.00 per direct-labor hour
In addition, the controller indicated that the Accounting Department would allocate $20,000 of fixed
administrative expenses to the Starter Set product line.
Required:
1. Compute the cost of a Starter Set using each of the four cost definitions commonly used in
cost-plus pricing formulas.
2. Determine the markup percentage required for the Starter Set product line to earn a target profit of
$317,500 before taxes during the next year. Use the total cost as the cost definition in the cost-plus
formula.

needs the 120,000 valves over the next four months to meet commitments to its regular customers.
Glasgow is prepared to pay $19 each for the valves. Badger’s total product cost, based on current attain-
able standards, for the pressure valve is $20, calculated as follows:
Direct material ..................................................................................................................................................... $ 5.00

Badger adds a 40 percent markup to total product cost. This provides a $28 suggested selling price
for the pressure valve. The Marketing Department, however, has set the current selling price at $27
in order to maintain market share. Production management believes that it can handle the Glasgow
Industries order without disrupting its scheduled production. The order would, however, require addi-
tional fixed factory overhead of $12,000 per month in the form of supervision and clerical costs. If
management accepts the order, 30,000 pressure valves will be manufactured and shipped to Glasgow
Industries each month for the next four months. Glasgow’s management has agreed to pay the ship-
ping charges for the valves.
Required:
1. Determine how many direct-labor hours would be required each month to fill the Glasgow
Industries order.
2. Prepare an analysis showing the impact of accepting the Glasgow Industries order.
3. Calculate the minimum unit price that Badger Valve and Fitting Company’s management could
accept for the Glasgow Industries order without reducing net income.
4. Identify the factors, other than price, that Badger’s management should consider before accepting
the Glasgow Industries order.

Wyant Memorial Hospital has asked North American Pharmaceuticals to bid on the packaging
of one million doses of medication at total cost plus a return on total cost of no more than 15 percent.
Wyant defines total cost as including all variable costs of performing the service, a reasonable amount
of fixed overhead, and reasonable administrative costs. The hospital will supply all packaging materials
and ingredients. Wyant has indicated that any bid over $.015 per dose will be rejected.
Greenway has accumulated the following information prior to the preparation of the bid.
Direct labor ..................................................................................................................... $8.00 per direct-labor hour (DLH)

The table currently costs $64 to produce and distribute, and DF’s selling price for this unit aver-
ages $80. An analysis of competitive tables in the marketplace revealed a variety of features, with some
models having all of the features that DF is considering and other models having only a few. The current
manufacturers’ selling prices for these tables averages $95.
Required:
1. Why is there a need in target costing to (a ) focus on the customer and (b ) have a marketing team
become involved with product design?
2. DF’s marketing team will evaluate the survey responses by computing a weighted-average rating
of each of the modifications. This will be accomplished by weighting (multiplying) the point
values (1, 2, etc.) by the frequency of responses, summing the results, and dividing by 200. Rank
the popularity of the five modifications using this approach.
3. Management desires to earn approximately the same rate of profit on sales that is being earned
with the current design.
a. If DF uses target costing and desires to meet the current competitive selling price, what is the
maximum cost of the modified table?
b. Which of the modifications should DF consider?
4. Assume that DF wanted to add a modification or two that you excluded in your answer to
requirement (3b ). What process might management adopt to allow the company to make its target

Engineering; ABC; JIT
product manager, for their 10-disc car compact disc (CD) changer. The report indicates another price

reduction is needed to meet anticipated competitors’ reductions in sales prices. The current selling
price for their 10-disc car CD changers is $350 per unit. It is expected that within three months PE’s 3. Pharsalia Electronics’
two major competitors will be selling their 10-disc car CD changers for $300 per unit. This concerns current profit on sales is 10
Kunselman because their current cost of producing the CD changers is $315, which yields a $35 profit percent
on each unit sold.
The situation is especially disturbing because PE had implemented an activity-based costing (ABC)
system about two years ago. The ABC system helped them better identify costs, cost pools, cost drivers,
and cost reduction opportunities. Changes made when adopting ABC reduced costs on this product by
approximately 15 percent during the last two years. Now it appears that costs will need to be reduced
considerably more to remain competitive and to earn a profit on the 10-disc car CD changers. Total costs
to produce, sell, and service the CD changer units are as follows:

678 Chapter 15 Target Costing and Cost Analysis for Pricing Decisions
Kunselman has decided to hire Donald Collins, a consultant, to help decide how to proceed. After
two weeks of review, discussion, and value engineering analysis, Collins suggested that PE adopt a
just-in-time (JIT) cell manufacturing process to help reduce costs. He also suggested that using target
costing would help in meeting the new target price.
By changing to a JIT cell manufacturing system, PE expects that manufacturing direct labor will
increase by $15 per finished unit. However, setup, material handling, inspection, and finished goods
warehousing will all be eliminated. Machining costs will be reduced from $35 to $30 per unit, and war-
ranty costs are expected to be reduced by 40 percent.
Required:
1. Define t arget costing.
2. Define v alue engineering.
3. Determine Pharsalia Electronics’ unit target cost at the $300 competitive sales price while main-
taining the same percentage of profit on sales as is earned on the current $350 sales price.
4. If the just-in-time cell manufacturing process is implemented with the changes in costs noted,
will Pharsalia Electronics meet the unit target cost you determined in requirement (3)? Prepare
a schedule detailing cost reductions and the unit cost under the proposed JIT cell manufacturing
process.

Direct material ................................................................................................................................................. $256,000
Direct labor (11,000 hours at $15) .................................................................................................................... 165,000
Manufacturing overhead is applied on the basis of direct-labor hours. Zylar normally plans to run
its plant at a level of 15,000 direct-labor hours per month and assigns overhead on the basis of 180,000
direct-labor hours per year. The overhead application rate for 20x1 of $9.00 per hour is based on the
following budgeted manufacturing overhead costs for 20x1.
Variable manufacturing overhead ................................................................................................................... $ 972,000
Fixed manufacturing overhead ....................................................................................................................... 648,000
Total manufacturing overhead ........................................................................................................................ $1,620,000
Zylar’s production schedule calls for 12,000 direct-labor hours per month during the first quarter.
If Zylar is awarded the contract for the Lyan equipment, production of one of its standard products
would have to be reduced. This is necessary because production levels can only be increased to 15,000
direct-labor hours each month on short notice. Furthermore, Zylar’s employees are unwilling to work
overtime.
Sales of the standard product equal to the reduced production would be lost, but there would be no
permanent loss of future sales or customers. The standard product for which the production schedule
would be reduced has a unit sales price of $12,000 and the following cost structure.

FOCUS COMPANY >>>
THIS CHAPTER’S FOCUS is on the City of Mountainview, New Mexico.
Mountainview’s mayor and city council face a variety of decisions that
involve cash flows over several periods of time. The decision tool used
in making such multiperiod decisions is called discounted-cash-flow
analysis, because it takes account of the timing of cash flows that occur
in different time periods. Among the decisions that Mountainview’s
leadership makes is whether to purchase a new computer system for
the city government. Since the City of Mountainview is not a profit-
seeking enterprise, income taxes play no role in the decisions
faced by the city’s leadership.

ment Stores. This chain of retail department stores, located in Mountainview, also faces
some significant decisions involving multiperiod cash flows. Since High Country is a
profit-seeking enterprise, it does pay income taxes. Therefore, when the company’s man-
agement uses discounted-cash-flow analysis, it must take taxes into account. Among the
decisions faced by High Country’s management is whether to purchase a new computerized
checkout system.

9 Describe the impact of activity-based costing and advanced manufacturing
technology on capital-budgeting decisions.
10 Explain the impact of inflation on a capital-budgeting analysis (Appendix B).
Managers in all organizations periodically face major decisions that involve cash flows
over several years. Decisions involving the acquisition of machinery, vehicles, build-
ings, or land are examples of such decisions. Other examples include decisions involving
significant changes in a production process or adding a major new line of products or
services to the organization’s activities.
Decisions involving cash inflows and outflows beyond the current year are called
capital-budgeting decisions. Managers encounter two types of capital-budgeting
decisions.
Acceptance-or-Rejection Decisions In acceptance-or-rejection decisions,
managers must decide whether they should undertake a particular capital investment
project. In such a decision, the required funds are available or readily obtainable, and
management must decide whether the project is worthwhile. For example, the controller
for the city of Mountainview is faced with a decision as to whether to replace one of the
city’s oldest street-cleaning machines. The funds are available in the city’s capital budget.
The question is whether the cost savings with the new machine will justify the expenditure.
Capital-Rationing Decisions In capital-rationing decisions, managers must
decide which of several worthwhile projects makes the best use of limited investment
funds. To illustrate, suppose the voters in the city of Mountainview have recently passed

Chapter 16 Capital Expenditure Decisions 687
a proposition mandating the city government to undertake a cost-reduction program
to trim administrative expenses. The voters also passed a bond issue, which enables
the city government to raise $100,000 through the sale of bonds, to provide capital
to finance the cost-reduction program. The mayor has in mind three cost-reduction
programs, each of which would reduce administrative costs significantly over the next
five years. However, the city can afford only two of the programs with the $100,000 of
investment capital available. The mayor’s decision problem is to decide which projects
to pursue.
Focus on Projects Capital-budgeting problems tend to focus on specific projects
or programs. Is it best for Mountainview to purchase the new street cleaner or not?
Which cost-reduction programs will provide the city with the greatest benefits? Should
a university buy a new electron microscope? Should a manufacturing firm acquire a
computer-integrated manufacturing system?
Over time, as managers make decisions about a variety of specific programs and
projects, the organization as a whole becomes the sum total of its individual investments,
activities, programs, and projects. The organization’s performance in any particular year
is the combined result of all the projects under way during that year.
Chapter Organization This chapter is divided into three modular sections, each
of which explores a particular aspect of capital expenditure decisions. Section 1 should
be studied first, after which either Section 2 or Section 3 may be studied.
• Section 1 : Discounted-Cash-Flow Analysis
• Section 2 : Income Taxes and Capital Budgeting
• Section 3 : Alternative Methods for Making Investment Decisions
Section 1: Discounted-Cash-Flow Analysis
How do managers evaluate capital investment projects? Our discussion will be illustrated
by several decisions made by the Mountainview city government. The controller of
Mountainview routinely advises the mayor and city council on major capital-investment
decisions.
Currently under consideration is the purchase of a new street cleaner. The controller
has estimated that the city’s old street-cleaning machine would last another five years. A
Learning Objective 1
new street cleaner, which also would last for five years, can be purchased for $50,470.

and save $70,000 over its five-year life ($70,000 ! 5 " $14,000 savings per year).
Since the $70,000 in cost savings exceeds the $50,470 acquisition cost, one might be
tempted to conclude that the new machine should be purchased. However, this analysis
is flawed, since it does not account for the time value of money. The $50,470 acquisi-
tion cost will occur now, but the cost savings are spread over a five-year period. It is a
mistake to add cash flows occurring at different points in time. The proper approach
is to use d iscounted-cash-flow analysis, which takes into account the timing of the
cash flows. There are two widely used methods of discounted-cash-flow analysis: the
net-present-value method and the internal-rate-of-return method. [Those who wish to
review the basic concept of present value should read Appendix II (on pages 772–778)
before continuing.]

688 Chapter 16 Capital Expenditure Decisions
Net-Present-Value Method
The following four steps constitute a net-present-value analysis of an investment proposal:
1. Prepare a table showing the cash flows during each year of the proposed investment.
2. Compute the present value of each cash flow, using a discount rate that reflects
the cost of acquiring investment capital. This discount rate is often called the
hurdle rate or minimum desired rate of return.
3. Compute the n et present value, which is the sum of the present values of the
cash flows.
4. If the net present value (NPV) is equal to or greater than zero, accept the invest-
ment proposal. Otherwise, reject it.
Exhibit 16–1 displays these four steps for the Mountainview controller’s street-cleaner
“We’re key members of decision. In step (2) the controller used a discount rate of 10 percent. Notice that the cost
the decision making team savings are $14,000 in each of the years 1 through 5. Thus, the cash flows in those years
when it comes to significant comprise a five-year, $14,000 annuity. The controller used the annuity discount factor
capital expenditure to compute the present value of the five years of cost savings. (The discount factors are
decisions.” (16a) found in Table IV in Appendix A at the end of this chapter.)
Ford Motor Company The net-present-value analysis indicates that the city should purchase the new street
cleaner. The present value of the cost savings exceeds the new machine’s acquisition cost.
Internal-Rate-of-Return Method
An alternative discounted-cash-flow method for analyzing investment proposals is the
internal-rate-of-return method. An asset’s i nternal rate of return (or t ime-adjusted
rate of return ) is the true economic return earned by the asset over its life. Another way
of stating the definition is that an asset’s internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate
that would be required in a net-present-value analysis in order for the asset’s net present
value to be exactly z ero.
What is the internal rate of return on Mountainview’s proposed street-cleaner acqui-
sition? Recall that the asset has a positive net present value, given that the city’s cost of
acquiring investment capital is 10 percent. Would you expect the asset’s IRR to be higher
or lower than 10 percent? Think about this question intuitively. The higher the discount
rate used in a net-present-value analysis, the lower the present value of all future cash
flows will be. This is true because a higher discount rate means that it is even more

important to have the money earlier instead of later. Thus, a discount rate higher than 10
percent would be required to drive the new street cleaner’s net present value down to zero.
Finding the Internal Rate of Return How can we find this rate? One way
is trial and error. We could experiment with different discount rates until we find the
one that yields a zero net present value. We already know that a 10 percent discount
rate yields a positive NPV. Let’s try 14 percent. Discounting the five-year, $14,000 cost-
savings annuity at 14 percent yields a negative NPV of $(2,408).

Annuity discount factor for r .14 and

What does this negative NPV at a 14 percent discount rate mean? We increased the
discount rate too much. Therefore, the street cleaner’s internal rate of return must lie
between 10 percent and 14 percent. Let’s try 12 percent:
3.605 $14,000 $50,470 0

Annuity discount factor for r .12 and
n 5 from Table IV in Appendix A.
That’s it. The new street cleaner’s internal rate of return is 12 percent. With a
12 percent discount rate, the investment proposal’s net present value is zero, since the
street cleaner’s acquisition cost is equal to the present value of the cost savings.
We could have found the internal rate of return more easily in this case, because
the street cleaner’s cash flows exhibit a very special pattern. The cash inflows in years 1
through 5 are identical, as shown below.

When we have this special pattern of cash flows, the internal rate of return is determined
in two steps, as follows:

Decision Rule Now that we have determined the investment proposal’s internal
rate of return to be 12 percent, how do we use this fact in making a decision? The
decision rule in the internal-rate-of-return method is to accept an investment proposal
if its internal rate of return is greater than the organization’s cost of capital (or hurdle

690 Chapter 16 Capital Expenditure Decisions
rate). Thus, Mountainview’s controller should recommend that the new street cleaner
be purchased. The internal rate of return on the proposal, 12 percent, exceeds the
city’s hurdle rate, 10 percent.
To summarize, the internal-rate-of-return method of discounted-cash-flow analysis
includes the following three steps:
1. Prepare a table showing the cash flows during each year of the proposed
investment. This table will be identical to the cash-flow table prepared under
the net-present-value method. (See Exhibit 16–1 .)
2. Compute the internal rate of return (IRR) for the proposed investment. This is
accomplished by finding a discount rate that yields a zero net present value for
the proposed investment.
3. If the IRR is equal to or greater than the hurdle rate (cost of acquiring invest-
ment capital), accept the investment proposal. Otherwise, reject it.
Recovery of Investment The reason for purchasing an asset is an expectation
“Our role is to be internal that it will provide benefits in the future. Thus, Mountainview may purchase the new
management consultants street cleaner because of expected future operating-cost savings. For a capital investment
for the key decisions facing proposal to be accepted, the expected future benefits must be sufficient for the purchaser
management.” (16b) to recover the investment and earn a return on the investment equal to or greater than the
Hewlett-Packard cost of acquiring capital. We can illustrate this point with Mountainview’s street-cleaner
acquisition.
Exhibit 16–2 examines the investment proposal’s cash flows from the perspective of
recovering the investment and earning a return on the investment. Focus on the Year 1
column in the exhibit. The street cleaner costs $50,470, so this is the unrecovered
investment at the beginning of year 1. The operating-cost savings in year 1 are $14,000.
Since the asset’s internal rate of return is 12 percent, it must earn $6,056 during the
first year (12% " $50,470). Therefore, $6,056 of the $14,000 cost savings represents a
return on the unrecovered investment. This leaves $7,944 as a recovery of the investment
during year 1 ($14,000 # $6,056). Subtracting the year 1 recovery of investment from the
unrecovered investment at the beginning of the year leaves an unrecovered investment of
$42,526 at year-end ($50,470 # $7,944).

Chapter 16 Capital Expenditure Decisions 691
Uneven Cash Flows A complication that often arises in finding a project’s
internal rate of return is an uneven pattern of cash flows. In Mountainview’s proposed
street-cleaner acquisition, the cost savings are $14,000 per year for all five years of the
machine’s life. Suppose, instead, that the pattern of cost savings is as follows:
Cost savings $14,000 $14,000 $12,000 $10,000 $8,000
Time
Year 1 2 3 4 5
Such an uneven cost-savings pattern is quite plausible, since the maintenance costs could
rise in the machine’s latter years. When the cash-flow pattern is uneven, iteration must
be used to find the internal rate of return. You can try various discount rates iteratively
until you find the one that yields a zero net present value for the investment proposal.
This sort of computationally intensive work is the kind of task for which computers are
designed. Numerous computer software packages are available to find a project’s IRR
almost instantaneously.

present value is equal to or greater than 2. Accept the investment proposal if its
zero; otherwise reject it. internal rate of return is equal to or
greater than the organization’s hurdle rate;
otherwise reject it.
Notice that the hurdle rate is used in each of the two methods.
Advantages of Net-Present-Value Method The net-present-value method
exhibits two potential advantages over the internal-rate-of-return method. First, if the
investment analysis is carried out by hand, it is easier to compute a project’s NPV than its
IRR. For example, if the cash flows are uneven across time, trial and error must be used
to find the IRR. This advantage of the NPV approach is not as important, however, when
a computer is used.
A second potential advantage of the NPV method is that the analyst can adjust for
risk considerations. For some investment proposals, the further into the future that a cash
flow occurs, the less certain the analyst can be about the amount of the cash flow. Thus,
the later a projected cash flow occurs, the riskier it may be. It is possible to adjust a net-
present-value analysis for such risk factors by using a higher discount rate for later cash
flows than earlier cash flows. It is not possible to include such a risk adjustment in the
internal-rate-of-return method, because the analysis solves for only a single discount rate,
the project’s IRR.
Assumptions Underlying Discounted-Cash-Flow Analysis
As is true of any decision model, discounted-cash-flow methods are based on assump-
tions. Four assumptions underlie the NPV and IRR methods of investment analysis.

PAGE 727
================================================================================

692 Chapter 16 Capital Expenditure Decisions
1. In the present-value calculations used in the NPV and IRR methods, all cash
flows are treated as though they occur at year-end. If the city of Mountainview
were to acquire the new street cleaner, the $14,000 in annual operating-cost
savings actually would occur uniformly throughout each year. The additional
computational complexity that would be required to reflect the exact timing of
all cash flows would complicate an investment analysis considerably. The error
introduced by the year-end cash-flow assumption generally is not large enough
to cause any concern.
2. Discounted-cash-flow analyses treat the cash flows associated with an invest-
ment project as though they were known with certainty. Although methods of
capital budgeting under uncertainty have been developed, they are not used
widely in practice. Most decision makers do not feel that the additional benefits
in improved decisions are worth the additional complexity involved. As men-
tioned above, however, risk adjustments can be made in an NPV analysis to
partially account for uncertainty about the cash flows.
3. Both the NPV and IRR methods assume that each cash inflow is immediately
reinvested in another project that earns a return for the organization. In the
NPV method, each cash inflow is assumed to be reinvested at the same rate
used to compute the project’s NPV, the organization’s hurdle rate. In the IRR
method, each cash inflow is assumed to be reinvested at the same rate as the
project’s internal rate of return.
What does this reinvestment assumption mean in practice? In the case of
Mountainview’s proposed new street cleaner, the city must instantly reinvest
the money saved each year either in some interest-bearing investment or in
some other capital project.
4. A discounted-cash-flow analysis assumes a perfect capital market. This implies
that money can be borrowed or lent at an interest rate equal to the hurdle rate
used in the analysis.
In practice, these four assumptions rarely are satisfied. Nevertheless, discounted-cash-
flow models provide an effective and widely used method of investment analysis. The
improved decision making that would result from using more complicated models sel-
dom is worth the additional cost of information and analysis.
Choosing the Hurdle Rate
The choice of a hurdle rate is a complex problem in finance. The hurdle rate is deter-
mined by management based on the investment opportunity rate. This is the rate of
return the organization can earn on its best alternative investments of equivalent risk. In
general, the greater a project’s risk is, the higher the hurdle rate should be.
Investment versus Financing Decisions In capital-expenditure decisions, the
investment decision should be separated from the financing decision. The decision as to
whether to invest in a project should be made first using a discounted-cash-flow approach
with a hurdle rate based on the investment opportunity rate. If a project is accepted, then
a separate analysis should be made as to the best way to finance the project.
Cost of Capital How do organizations generate investment capital? Nonprofit
organizations, such as local, city, and state governments and charitable organizations,
often acquire capital through special bond issues or borrowing from financial institutions.
In such cases, the cost of capital is based on the interest rate paid on the debt.
Another source of capital for both nonprofit and profit-oriented organizations is invested
funds, such as a university’s endowment fund. In this case, the cost of using the capital for
an investment project is the interest rate forgone on the original investment. For example,

================================================================================
PAGE 728
================================================================================

Chapter 16 Capital Expenditure Decisions 693
suppose your university’s endowment earns interest at the rate of 10 percent. If the university
uses a portion of these funds to buy new laboratory equipment, the cost of capital is the
10 percent interest rate that is no longer earned on the funds removed from the endowment.
Profit-oriented enterprises fund capital projects by borrowing, by issuing stock, or by
using invested funds. In most cases, capital projects are funded by all of these sources.
Then the cost of capital should be a combination of the costs of obtaining money from
each of these sources.
Depreciable Assets
When a long-lived asset is purchased, its acquisition cost is allocated to the time peri-
ods in the asset’s life through depreciation charges. However, we did not include any
depreciation charges in our discounted-cash-flow analysis. Both the NPV and IRR meth-
ods focus on cash flows, and periodic depreciation charges are not cash flows. Suppose
that the controller for the city of Mountainview depreciates assets using the straight-line
method. If the city purchases the new street cleaner for $50,470, the depreciation charges
will be recorded as follows:
Acquisition
cost
$50,470
Annual straight-line depreciation (D)
D = $10,094 D = $10,094 D = $10,094 D = $10,094 D = $10,094
Time
Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5
Depreciation charges are
Acquisition

cash outflow
The only cash flow in the diagram above is the $50,470 cash outflow incurred
to acquire the street cleaner. The $10,094 annual depreciation charges are not cash
flows. Thus, the acquisition cost is recorded as a cash flow in our investment analysis
( Exhibit 16–1 ), but the annual depreciation charges are not.
Nonprofit versus Profit-Oriented Organizations Suppose our illustra-
tion had focused on a profit-seeking enterprise instead of the city of Mountainview. For
example, if the street-cleaner acquisition is contemplated by a theme-park company,
would this change our treatment of the annual depreciation charges for the street cleaner?
The depreciation charges still are not cash flows. However, in a profit-seeking enterprise,
depreciation expense is deductible for income-tax purposes. Since tax payments a re cash
flows, the reduction in tax due to depreciation expense is a legitimate cash flow that
should be included in an investment analysis. In Section 2 of this chapter, we will study
the tax implications of depreciable assets in detail. For now, let’s return to our focus on
the city of Mountainview. As a nonprofit enterprise, the city pays no income tax. There-
fore, depreciation is irrelevant in our discounted-cash-flow analysis.

694 Chapter 16 Capital Expenditure Decisions
The computing system used by the city of Mountainview is outdated. The city coun-
cil has voted to purchase a new computing system to be funded through municipal bonds.
The mayor has asked the city’s controller to make a recommendation as to which of two
computing systems should be purchased. The two systems are equivalent in their ability
to meet the city’s needs and in their ease of use. The mainframe system consists of one
large mainframe computer with remote terminals and printers located throughout the city
offices. The personal computer system consists of a much smaller mainframe computer,
a few remote terminals, and a dozen personal computers, which will be networked to the
small mainframe. Each system would last five years. The controller has decided to use a
12 percent hurdle rate for the analysis.
Exhibit 16–3 presents data pertinent to the decision. Examine these data care-
fully. Most of the items are self-explanatory. Item (9) is the annual cost of a data-link
service. This service enables Mountainview to participate in a nationwide computer
network, which allows cities to exchange information on such issues as crime rates,
demographic data, and economic data. Item (10) is the revenue the city will receive
from two time-sharing customers. The Mountainview City School District and the
county legislature each has agreed to pay the city in return for a limited amount of time
on the city’s computer.
Before we begin the steps of the net-present-value method, let’s examine the cash-
flow data in Exhibit 16–3 to determine if any of the data can be ignored as irrelevant.
Notice that items (1) and (9) do not differ between the two alternatives. Regardless of
which new computing system is purchased, certain components of the old system can be
sold now for $25,000. Moreover, the data-link service will cost $20,000 annually, regard-
less of which system is acquired. If the only purpose of the NPV analysis is to determine

Chapter 16 Capital Expenditure Decisions 695
which computer system is the least-cost alternative, items (1) and (9) can be ignored as
irrelevant, since they will affect both alternatives’ NPVs equally.
Total-Cost Approach Exhibit 16–4 displays a net-present-value analysis of the
two alternative computing systems. The exhibit uses the total-cost approach, in which all
of the relevant costs of each computing system are included in the analysis. Then the net
present value of the cost of the mainframe system is compared with that of the personal
computer system. Since the NPV of the costs is lower with the personal computer system,
that will be the controller’s recommendation to the Mountainview City Council.
A decision such as Mountainview’s computing-system choice, in which the objective
is to select the alternative with the lowest cost, is called a l east-cost decision. Rather than
maximizing the NPV of cash inflows minus cash outflows, the objective is to minimize
the NPV of the costs to be incurred.
Incremental-Cost Approach Exhibit 16–5 displays a different net-present-value
analysis of the city’s two alternative computing systems. This exhibit uses the incremental-

Incremental-Cost Approach
The result of this analysis is that the NPV of the costs of the mainframe system exceeds
that of the personal computer system by $327,820. Notice that this is the same as the dif-
ference in NPVs shown at the bottom of Exhibit 16–4 .
The total-cost and incremental-cost approaches always will yield equivalent conclu-
sions. Choosing between them is a matter of personal preference.
Managerial Accountant’s Role
To use discounted-cash-flow analysis in deciding about investment projects, managers
need accurate cash-flow projections. This is where the managerial accountant plays a
role. The accountant often is asked to predict cash flows related to operating-cost savings,
additional working-capital requirements, or incremental costs and revenues. Such
predictions are difficult in a world of uncertainty. The managerial accountant often draws
upon historical accounting data to help in making cost predictions. Knowledge of market
conditions, economic trends, and the likely reactions of competitors also can be impor-
tant in projecting cash flows.

Real Option Analysis
One way managerial accountants can assist the management team is by assessing the
consequences of changes in an investment decision that may develop after the project has
been approved. In long-term projects, there is often considerable uncertainty about the
future cash flows, due to uncertainty about future economic, political, or cultural events.
As a project unfolds, management may decide to alter the course of the project or even
postpone it. Suppose, for example, that the city of Mountainview decides to build a new
municipal water system that will take 5 years to build and is expected to last 75 years.
The project involves collaboration with several private enterprises, other municipalities,
and the state and federal governments. As the project develops and various uncertainties
are resolved, it may be desirable to make changes in the water system or postpone certain
parts of it. A capital-budgeting tool called real option analysis can be used to quantify
and analyze the merits of such changes. Real option analysis is covered in advanced cost
management and finance courses.
Section 2: Income Taxes and Capital Budgeting
When a business makes a profit, it usually must pay income taxes, just as individuals do.

Income ! Revenue # Expenses $ Gains # Losses
Any aspect of an investment project that affects any of the items in this equation
generally will affect the company’s income-tax payments. These income-tax payments
are cash flows, and they must be considered in any discounted-cash-flow analysis. In
some cases, tax considerations are so crucial in a capital-investment decision that they
dominate all other aspects of the analysis.
After-Tax Cash Flows
The first step in a discounted-cash-flow analysis for a profit-seeking enterprise is to
determine the after-tax cash flows associated with the investment projects under consid-
eration. An after-tax cash flow is the cash flow expected after all tax implications have
been taken into account. Each financial aspect of a project must be examined carefully to
determine its potential tax impact.

698 Chapter 16 Capital Expenditure Decisions
To illustrate the tax implications of various types of financial items, we will focus on
a retail business. High Country Department Stores, Inc. operates two department stores in
the city of Mountainview. The firm has a large downtown store and a smaller branch store
in the suburbs. The company is quite profitable, and management is considering several
capital projects that will enhance the firm’s future profit potential. Before analyzing these
HIGH COUNTRY
projects, let’s pause to consider the tax issues the company is likely to face. For the pur-
DEPARTMENTSTORES
poses of our discussion, we will assume that High Country Department Stores’ income
tax rate is 40 percent. Thus, if the company’s net income is $1,000,000, its income-tax
payment will be $400,000 ($1,000,000 " 40%).
Cash Revenue Suppose High Country’s management is considering the purchase
of an additional delivery truck. The sales manager estimates that a new truck will allow
the company to increase annual sales revenue by $110,000. Further suppose that this
incremental sales revenue will be received in cash during the year of sale. Any credit
sales will be paid in cash within a short time period. High Country’s additional annual
sales revenue will result in an increase of $60,000 per year in cost of goods sold. More-
over, the additional merchandise sold will be paid for in cash during the same year as the
related sales. Thus, the net incremental cash inflow resulting from the sales increase is
$50,000 per year ($110,000 # $60,000).
What is High Country’s after-tax cash flow from the incremental sales revenue, net
of cost of goods sold? As the following calculation shows, the firm’s incremental cash
inflow from the additional sales is only $30,000.
Incremental sales revenue, net of cost of goods sold (cash inflow) ....................................................................... $50,000
Incremental income tax (cash outflow), $50,000 " 40% ................................................................................... (20,000)
After-tax cash flow (net inflow after taxes) ......................................................................................................... $30,000
Although the incremental sales amounted to an additional net cash inflow of $50,000,
the cash outflow for income taxes also increased by $20,000. Thus, the after-tax cash
inflow from the incremental sales, net of cost of goods sold, is $30,000.
A quick method for computing the after-tax cash inflow from incremental sales is the
following:
I nc rem en tal sal es rev enu e ,
" (1 # Tax rate) !
A fter -ta x
net of cost of goods sold cash inflow
$50,000 " (1 # .40) ! $30,000
Cash Expenses What are the tax implications of cash expenses? Suppose the
addition of the delivery truck under consideration by High Country’s management will
involve hiring an additional employee, whose annual compensation and fringe benefits
will amount to $30,000. As the following computation shows, the company’s incremental
cash outflow is only $18,000.
Incremental expense (cash outflow) .................................................................................................................. $(30,000)
Reduction in income tax (reduced cash outflow), $30,000 " 40% ..................................................................... 12,000
After-tax cash flow (net outflow after taxes) ...................................................................................................... $(18,000)
Although the incremental employee compensation is $30,000, this expense is tax-
deductible. Thus, the firm’s income-tax payment will be reduced by $12,000. As a result,
the after-tax cash outflow from the additional compensation is $18,000.
A quick method for computing the after-tax cash outflow from an incremental cash
expense is given in the following equation:

Chapter 16 Capital Expenditure Decisions 699
Noncash Expenses Not all expenses represent cash outflows. The most common
example of a noncash expense is depreciation expense. Suppose High Country Depart-
ment Stores’ management is considering the purchase of a delivery truck that costs
$40,000 and has no salvage value. We will discuss the specific methods of depreciation
allowed under the tax law later in the chapter, but for now assume the truck will be depre-
ciated as follows:
Acquisition
cost:
$40,000
Depreciation: Depreciation: Depreciation: Depreciation: Depreciation:
$5,000 $10,000 $10,000 $10,000 $5,000
Time
0 1 2 3 4 5
The only cash flow shown in the diagram above is the truck’s acquisition cost of
$40,000 at time zero. The depreciation expense in each of the next five years is n ot a cash
flow. However, d epreciation is an expense on the income statement, and it reduces the
firm’s income. For example, the $5,000 depreciation expense in year 1 will reduce High
Country’s income by $5,000. As a result, the company’s year 1 income-tax payment will
decline by $2,000 (40% " $5,000).
The annual depreciation expense associated with the truck provides a reduction in
income-tax expense equal to the firm’s tax rate times the depreciation deduction. This
reduction in income taxes is called a d epreciation tax shield.
To summarize, depreciation is a noncash expense. Although depreciation is not a
cash flow, it does cause a reduced cash outflow through the depreciation tax shield.

The cash flows constituting the depreciation tax shield occur in five different years.
u
Thus, in a discounted-cash-flow analysis, we still must discount these cash flows to find
their present value.
Cash Flows Not on the Income Statement Some cash flows do not appear
on the income statement. They are not revenues, expenses, gains, or losses. A common
example of such a cash flow is the purchase of an asset. If High Country Department
Stores purchases the delivery truck, the $40,000 acquisition cost is a cash outflow but
not an expense. A purchase is merely the exchange of one asset (cash) for another (a
delivery truck). The expense associated with the truck’s purchase is recognized through

700 Chapter 16 Capital Expenditure Decisions
depreciation expense recorded throughout the asset’s depreciable life. Thus, the cash
flow resulting from the purchase of an asset does not affect income and has no direct tax
consequences.
Net-Present-Value Analysis Now let’s complete our example by preparing a
net-present-value analysis of the proposed delivery-truck acquisition. The company’s
after-tax hurdle rate is 10 percent. Exhibit 16–6 displays the net-present-value analysis.
Since the NPV is positive, the delivery truck should be purchased.
Timing of Tax Deductions We have assumed in our analysis of High Country
Department Stores’ delivery-truck purchase that the cash flows resulting from income
taxes occur during the same year as the related before-tax cash flows. This assumption is
realistic, as most businesses must make estimated tax payments throughout the tax year.
They generally cannot wait until the following year and pay their prior year’s taxes in one
lump sum.
Inflation Our discussion of discounted-cash-flow analysis has assumed no inflation.
The additional complexity of inflation is discussed in Appendix B at the end of this chapter.
Accelerated Depreciation
The main concept underlying discounted-cash-flow analysis is the time value of money.
We discount each cash flow to find its present value. Since money has a time value, it is
advantageous for a business to take tax deductions as early as allowable under the tax law.
Exhibit 16–6 Although federal and state income tax laws are changed periodically by the appro-
Net-Present-Value Analysis priate governmental legislative bodies, income-tax laws usually permit some form of
with After-Tax Cash Flows accelerated depreciation for tax purposes. An accelerated depreciation method is any
method under which an asset is depreciated more quickly in the early part of its life
than it would be by using straight-line depreciation. For example, suppose High Country
Department Stores purchased a personal computer and peripheral devices for $10,000.
The equipment’s useful life is four years with no salvage value. Exhibit 16–7 shows the

purpose. Thus, management could use straight-line depreciation when preparing pub- Boeing
lished financial statements but use an accelerated method for tax purposes.
Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS)
Under U.S. tax laws, most depreciable assets acquired after December 31, 1980, have been
Learning Objective 5
depreciated for tax purposes in accordance with the Accelerated Cost Recovery System
(ACRS). The Tax Reform Acts of 1986, 1989, and 1993 modified the ACRS depreciation Use the Modified Accelerated

years over which the asset may be depreciated, and the depreciation method to be used.
These specifications are shown in column (c) of Exhibit 16–8 . Notice that the number of
years of depreciation specified by the tax code is not the same as an asset’s useful life.
Thus, each asset’s useful life is used only to place the asset in its appropriate MACRS
class. Then the tax code specifies the appropriate number of years of depreciation.1

* Steps in applying the double-declining-balance (DDB) method:
To apply the double-declining-balance depreciation method, use the following steps:
1. Divide 100% by the number of years of depreciation to be taken.
2. Multiply the answer obtained in step (1) by 200%.
3. Compute the asset’s depreciation each year by applying the percentage obtained in step (2) to the asset’s undepreciated cost at the beginning
of the year.
4. Switch to straight-line depreciation during the first year in which the straight-line amount, computed for the asset’s remaining life, is greater
than the double-declining-balance amount.
1 The U.S. tax law changes almost every year. Occasionally, changes are made in the assignment of assets to
property classes and in the associated depreciation schedules. Moreover, the terminology frequently changes. The
tax act of 1980 established the Accelerated Cost Recovery System, which then was referred to as ACRS. Since the
tax act of 1986, the program has been referred to in various publications by a variety of names. Among these are the
Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS), the ACRS as modified, the CRS, or simply the ACRS. We
will follow the common convention of referring to the current system as MACRS. Our discussion incorporates the
latest tax law changes known as this book went to press. Regardless of what minor changes the tax laws may make
in terminology or depreciation schedules, it is likely that the tax code will continue to allow depreciation by an
accelerated schedule similar to MACRS.

702 Chapter 16 Capital Expenditure Decisions
Depreciation Methods As Exhibit 16–8 indicates, assets in the 3-year, 5-year,
7-year, and 10-year MACRS property classes are depreciated using the double-declining-
balance (DDB) method. Assets in the 15-year and 20-year MACRS property classes
are depreciated using the 150%-declining-balance method. To apply this depreciation
method, use the same steps as those listed in Exhibit 16–7 for the DDB method, except
change 200% in step (2) to 150%. Assets in the 27.5-year and 39-year MACRS property
classes are depreciated using the straight-line method.
Half-Year Convention An asset may be
purchased at any time during the tax year. MACRS
assumes that, on average, assets will be placed in
service halfway through the tax year. Thus, the
tax code allows only a half-year’s depreciation
during the tax year in which an asset is placed in
service. The other half of the first year’s deprecia-
tion is picked up in the second tax year in which
the asset is in service. The following diagram
shows the pattern with which a five-year asset’s
depreciation is recorded, for tax purposes, under
MACRS.
MACRS Depreciation Tables To assist
taxpayers, the Internal Revenue Service has pub-
lished tables of the MACRS depreciation percent-
ages for each MACRS property class. The IRS
tables use the depreciation method specified in
Exhibit 16–8 and incorporate the half-year con-
vention. Exhibit 16–9 provides a convenient table
of the MACRS percentages, as computed by the IRS, for selected property classes. In the
5-year column, we see 20 percent for year 1. This results from the half-year convention,
since 20 percent is half of the double-declining balance rate of 40 percent.

Chapter 16 Capital Expenditure Decisions 703
No Salvage Values Under MACRS, an asset’s estimated salvage value is not sub-
tracted in computing the asset’s depreciation basis. Thus, for an asset costing $10,000
with an estimated salvage value of $1,000, the full $10,000 cost is depreciated over the
asset’s life.
Optional Straight-Line Depreciation The tax law permits a business to
depreciate any asset using the straight-line method instead of the method prescribed
in Exhibit 16–8 . A business with a loss might prefer this approach for tax reasons. If
the straight-line method is used, the business may depreciate the asset over either the
MACRS life or the asset’s estimated useful life. Thus, businesses have considerable flex-
ibility in choosing a depreciation schedule for tax purposes. Regardless of the deprecia-
tion method chosen, the half-year convention still must be followed.
Income-Tax Complexities The U.S. tax code is a complex document with a mul-
titude of provisions. It is not possible to cover all of these provisions in this text, so it “The tax issues can often

important tax-code provision that has been switched on and off repeatedly by Congress.
During periods when the investment tax credit has been in effect, a company has been
allowed a substantial reduction in its income taxes when particular types of investments
are made. The intent of the investment credit was to stimulate the economy by giving
businesses an incentive to make new investments. The status of the investment tax credit
is always subject to change. If there is a moral to the changing-tax-code story, it is this:
When making an important investment decision, a manager should have a managerial
accountant on one side and a tax accountant on the other.
Gains and Losses on Disposal
When a business sells an asset, there often is a gain or loss on the sale. Since gains and

losses are included in income, the business’s income taxes generally are affected. Capital
investment decisions frequently involve the disposal of assets, and sometimes gains or Evaluate an investment proposal

value, a gain on disposal is recorded. The gain is defined as the difference between the
sales proceeds and the asset’s book value. A l oss on disposal is recorded when an asset is
sold for less than its current book value. The loss is equal to the difference between the
asset’s current book value and the sales proceeds.
To illustrate, suppose High Country Department Stores owns a forklift, which cost
$10,000 and currently has accumulated depreciation of $6,000. The forklift’s book value
is computed as follows:
Book value ! Acquisition cost # Accumulated depreciation
$4,000 ! 10,000 # $6,000
Scenario I: Gain on Disposal Suppose High Country sells the forklift for
$5,000. The gain on the sale is $1,000 ($5,000 proceeds minus $4,000 book value). If
High Country’s income-tax rate is 40 percent, the following cash flows will occur at the
time of the sale.
Cash inflow: proceeds from sale ......................................................................................................................... $5,000
Cash outflow: incremental income tax due to the gain, $1,000 " 40% ................................................................. (400)
Net cash flow ..................................................................................................................................................... $4,600
Although High Country sold the forklift for $5,000, the company’s net cash benefit is
only $4,600. The firm will have to pay the other $400 in increased income taxes on the
$1,000 gain.
Scenario II: Loss on Disposal Now assume instead that High Country Depart-
ment Stores sells the forklift for $3,200. The l oss on the sale is $800 ($3,200 proceeds
minus $4,000 book value). If High Country’s income-tax rate is 40 percent, the following
cash flows will occur at the time of the sale.
Cash inflow: proceeds from sale ......................................................................................................................... $3,200
Reduced cash outflow: reduction in income tax due to the loss, $800 " 40% ....................................................... 320
Total cash flow ................................................................................................................................................... $3,520
Although High Country sold the forklift for only $3,200, the company’s total benefit
from the sale is $3,520. The extra $320 comes in the form of a reduction in income taxes
due to the loss on the sale.
Tax Rates on Gains and Losses Another complexity of the tax code that
changes from time to time is that capital gains and losses may be taxed at different rates
than ordinary income (i.e., revenue minus expenses). Thus, before preparing an NPV
analysis, it is wise to check with a tax expert to obtain the proper income-tax rate to apply
to a gain or loss on disposal.

is largely due to a higher balance in merchandise inventory. Panel B of Exhibit 16–10
analyzes the contract proposal. Notice that the time 0 cash investment in working capital
is included as a $2,000 cash outflow. Since the increase in working capital is not released
until the end of year 3, that $2,000 inflow is discounted. The city’s proposal has a positive
net present value, so it should be accepted.
Notice that the presentation format used for the analysis in Exhibit 16–10 is different
from the format we used previously. Instead of listing the cash flows for each item by
year and then adding the columns, we have computed the present value of each financial
item pertinent to the decision. The one-time cash flows at time zero then are added to the
present value of the cost-savings annuity to determine the net present value. This alter-
native presentation format will yield the same conclusion as the year-by-year, columnar
approach. The choice of format is a matter of personal preference.

more years if an overhaul is done in year 2. The new equipment also has an expected use-
ful life of six years, so its MACRS classification is the 5-year property class.
Most of the data in Exhibit 16–11 are self-explanatory. The last two items in the
exhibit under annual data relate to the new checkout system’s ability to gather data about
customer demand patterns. The extra data analysis will cost $4,500 annually, but it is
expected to generate another $40,000 in annual sales, net of cost of goods sold.
A net-present-value analysis of the checkout equipment proposal is presented in
Exhibit 16–12 . A total-cost approach is used. The present value of each financial item
is computed for both alternatives; then these present values are added to determine each
alternative’s net present value. An explanation of each line in the exhibit follows.
(1) Line (1) in Exhibit 16–12 records the acquisition cost of the new checkout
equipment. This cash flow has no tax impact and does not need to be discounted
since it occurs at time 0.
(2), (3) These one-time cash flows are required to retrain checkout personnel and
retag merchandise to accommodate the new bar-code readers. Since these costs are
expenses, we multiply by (1 # .40).
(4), (5) Since the old equipment has a current book value of zero, there is a $1,200
gain on the sale. The $1,200 proceeds are not taxed [line (4)], but the $1,200 gain
on the sale is taxed [line (5)].
(6) The cost of updating the software in year 3 is an expense, so we multiply by
(1 # .40).

A ccounting CAPITAL BUDGETING AT PHARMACEUTICAL FIRMS
P ractice Among the many large companies making extensive use of capital budgeting are the
big pharmaceutical companies. It can take 10 years or more to develop a new drug. It
Pfizer and Merck
takes huge outlays of cash to develop a drug, test it, and then shepherd it through the
governmental approval process. Yet much of what the drug companies claim as the cost
of a new drug is actually the opportunity cost of tying up these big dollar outlays for many
years before any revenue stream begins.
“Overall, the average tab for developing a new drug is $500 million to $880 mil-
lion, the industry says. But the amount actually spent on any one marketable product is
roughly one-quarter of that. To understand why, just look at the drug-development pro-
cess. In the past, scientists made many variations of existing chemicals and tested them
to see which ones had the ability to fight a particular disease.” Now, with the advent of
genetic engineering and greatly expanded knowledge of biology, “the process has gotten
more complicated—and oddly enough, more difficult. Researchers try to identify the best
target in a particular disease—for instance, a damaged gene that causes cancer—then
they make a drug to hit the target and cure the disease. Since that process can take 10
years or more, that means that about half of the calculated $500 million to $880 million
total isn’t actually spent at all. Instead, it’s the opportunity cost—the measure of what
the money tied up in the drug for so many years could have earned with alternative
investments.” This is where capital budgeting comes into play, since the NPV of a drug
development project takes into account the opportunity cost associated with the time
value of money.
Pharmaceutical companies “have upped research spending in recent years—P fizer
spends $4.9 billion annually; M erck, about $2.6 billion—but with no big payoff in produc-
tivity. Hefty up-front investments in genomics, in particular, have so far failed to yield a big
crop of new compounds.” The uncertainties big pharmaceutical companies confront are a
large part of the problem. First, only a small percentage of drugs under development ever
make it as far as human trials. And only 1 in 10 of those makes it through to wide-scale
testing. Then there’s the pricing uncertainty as well. How much will people pay for a new
drug treatment? To take account of these uncertainties, many drug companies use simu-
lation in conjunction with capital budgeting to decide whether to proceed with a drug’s
development. A discounted-cash-flow analysis is run many times with differing assump-
tions about the drug’s success, its development costs, and its eventual pricing. Then a
probability distribution is generated for the drug’s NPV. Management can then make a
decision about proceeding with development given the likelihood of a profitable drug. 2
will be on the income statement. The after-tax cash-flow annuity of $12,300 is then
discounted using the annuity discount factor for n ! 6 and r ! .10.
(14) The net present value of the new equipment is $13,482.
(15) The only specific cash flow related to the alternative of keeping the old equip-
ment is the $3,500 overhaul in year 2. This will be an expense, so we multiply by
(1 # .40). Then the after-tax cash flow is discounted.
(16) The net present value of the alternative to keep the old equipment is $(1,735).2

Chapter 16 Capital Expenditure Decisions 709
Decision Rule The analysis indicates that High Country Department Stores should
purchase the new checkout equipment. The NPV of the new equipment exceeds that of
the old equipment.
Ranking Investment Projects
Suppose a company has several potential investment projects, all of which have positive
Learning Objective 7
net present values. If a project has a positive net present value, this means that the return
projected for the project exceeds the company’s cost of capital. In this case, every project Discuss the difficulty of ranking
with a positive NPV should be accepted. In spite of the theoretical validity of this argu- investment proposals, and use
ment, practice often does not reflect this viewpoint. In practice, managers often attempt the profitability index.
to rank investment projects with positive net present values. Then only a limited number
of the higher-ranking proposals are accepted.
The reasons for this common practice are not clear. If a discount rate is used that
accurately reflects the firm’s cost of capital, then any project with a positive NPV will
earn a return greater than the cost of obtaining capital to fund it. One possible explanation
for the practice of ranking investment projects is a limited supply of scarce resources,
such as managerial talent. Thus, a form of capital rationing takes place, not because of
a limited supply of investment capital, but because of limitations on other resources. A
manager may feel that he or she simply cannot devote sufficient attention to all of the
desirable projects. The solution, then, is to select only some of the positive-NPV propos-
als, which implies a ranking.
Unfortunately, no valid method exists for ranking independent investment projects
with positive net present values. To illustrate, suppose the management of High Country
Department Stores has the following two investment opportunities:
1. Proposal A: Open a gift shop at the Mountainview Convention Center. High
Country’s management believes the benefits of this proposal would last only
six years. High Country’s management expects that after six years, the firm’s
competitors will move into the Convention Center and eliminate High Coun-
try’s current advantageous position.
2. Proposal B: Open a small gift shop at the Mountainview Airport. The airport
gift concession would belong to High Country Department Stores for 10 years
under a contract with the city.
The predicted cash flows for these investment proposals are as follows:
Cash Outflow After-Tax Cash Inflows Present Value of Net Internal
Inflows Present Rate of
Investment Proposal Time 0 Years 1–6 Years 7–10 (10% Discount Rate) Value Return
A (Convention Center) $ (54,450) $14,000 — $ 60,970 $6,520 14%
B (Airport) (101,700) 18,000 $18,000 110,610 8,910 12%
Both investment proposals have positive net present values. Suppose, however, that
due to limited managerial time, High Country’s management has decided to pursue only
one of the projects. Which proposal should be ranked higher? This is a difficult question
to answer. Proposal B has a higher net present value, but it also requires a much larger
initial investment. Proposal A exhibits a higher internal rate of return. However, proposal
A’s return of 14 percent applies only to its six-year time horizon. If management accepts
proposal A, what will happen in years 7 through 10? Will the facilities and equipment
remain idle? Or could they be used profitably for some other purpose? These questions
are left unanswered by the analysis above.
The main reason that the NPV and IRR methods of analysis yield different rank-
ings for these two proposals is that the projects have different lives. Without making an
assumption about what will happen in years 7 through 10 if proposal A is accepted, the

================================================================================
PAGE 745
================================================================================

710 Chapter 16 Capital Expenditure Decisions
NPV and IRR methods simply are not capable of ranking the proposals in any sound
manner. The only theoretically correct answer to the problem posed in this illustration is
that both projects are desirable, and both should be accepted. Each proposal exhibits a
positive NPV and an IRR greater than the hurdle rate of 10 percent.
Profitability Index One criterion that managers sometimes apply in ranking
investment proposals is called the profitability index (or excess present value index ),
which is defined as follows:
Pr ese nt v al ue of c a s h fl ow s,
Profitability index ! _ ex_c_l_u_s_iv_e_ _ o_f_ i_n_it_ia_l_ i_n _v_e_s _tm__e_n_t
Initial investment
The profitability indices for High Country’s two investment proposals are computed as
follows:
Investment Profitability Net Internal
Proposal Calculation Index Present Value Rate of Return
A _P_re_s_e_nt_ v_a_lu_ e_ _o_f i_n_fl_o w__s ! _ $_6_0_,9_7_0_ ! 1.12 $6,520 14%

Initial investment $101,700
< < <
Although proposal A has a lower NPV than proposal B, proposal A exhibits a higher
profitability index. Proposal A’s higher profitability index is due to its considerably lower
initial investment than that required for proposal B. Is the profitability index a foolproof
method for ranking investment proposals? Unfortunately, it too suffers from the same
drawbacks as those associated with the NPV or IRR method. Both proposals exhibit a
profitability index greater than 1.00, which merely reflects their positive NPVs. Thus,
both projects are desirable. The unequal lives of the two proposals prevent the profitability
index from indicating a theoretically correct ranking of the proposals. The relative desir-
ability of proposals A and B simply depends on what will happen in years 7 through 10
if proposal A is selected.
In summary, the problem of ranking investment projects with positive NPVs has not
been solved in a satisfactory manner. This lack of resolution is due to an inconsistency
inherent to the problem. The inconsistency is that if several projects have positive NPVs,
they all are desirable. They all will earn a return greater than the cost of capital. If a
manager chooses not to accept all projects with positive NPVs, then the required ranking
ultimately must be made on the basis of subjective criteria.

making investment decisions. In some cases, these alternative methods are used in
conjunction with a discounted-cash-flow analysis. Two of these alternative decision
methods are described next.
Our discussion is based on decisions faced by the management of High Country

Chapter 16 Capital Expenditure Decisions 711
Payback Method
The payback period of an investment proposal is the amount of time it will take for
the after-tax cash inflows from the project to accumulate to an amount that covers the
original investment. The following formula defines an investment project’s payback
period.
Initial investment
Payback period ! _ _______ __ ______ ___ ____
Annual after-tax cash inflow
There is no adjustment in the payback method for the time value of money. A cash
inflow in year 5 is treated the same as a cash inflow in year 1.
To illustrate the payback method, suppose High Country Department Stores’
management is considering the purchase of a new conveyor system for its warehouse.
The two alternative machines under consideration have the following projected cash
flows.
Conveyor Initial After-Tax Cash Flows: After-Tax Cash Flow
System Investment Years 1 through 7 When System Is Sold
I ............................... $(20,000) ........................ $4,000 .......................... –0–
II .............................. (27,000) ........................ 4,500 .......................... $14,000
The payback period for each conveyor system is computed below. Notice that after-
tax cash flows are used in the payback method, just as they are in discounted-cash-flow
methods of analysis.
Initial Investment
Conveyor Payback
System Annual After-Tax Cash Inflow Period
I ..................................... _ $_2_0_,0_0_0_ ......................... 5 years
$4,000
II .................................... _ $_2_7_,0_0_0_ ......................... 6 years
$4,500
According to the payback method, system I is more desirable than system II. System I
will “pay back” its initial investment in five years, while system II requires six years. This
conclusion is too simplistic, however, because it ignores the large salvage value associ-
ated with system II. Indeed, the NPV of system I is negative, while the NPV of system II
is positive, as shown in the following analysis.
Present Value of Cash Flows (10% Discount Factor)
After-Tax Cash Flows System I System II
Initial investment $(20,000) " 1.000 ! $(20,000) $(27,000) " 1.000 ! $(27,000)
Years 1–7 4,000 " 4.868 ! 19,472 4,500 " 4.868 ! 21,906
Cash inflow from sale –0– 14,000 " .513 ! 7,182
Net present value $ (528) $ 2,088
The net-present-value analysis demonstrates that only system II can generate cash
flows sufficient to cover the company’s cost of capital. The payback method makes it
appear as though system I “pays back” its initial investment more quickly, but the method
fails to consider the time value of money.
Another shortcoming of the payback method is that it fails to consider an invest-
ment project’s profitability beyond the payback period. Suppose High Country Depart-
ment Stores’ management has a third alternative for its warehouse conveyor system.
System III requires an initial investment of only $12,000 and will generate after-tax
hiL10912_ch16_684-737.indd 711 7/26/10 11:13 AM
================================================================================
PAGE 747
================================================================================

712 Chapter 16 Capital Expenditure Decisions
cash inflows of $6,000 in years 1 and 2. Thus, System III’s payback period is two years,
as computed below.
$12,000
System III payback period ! _ ______ ! 2 years
$6,000
Strict adherence to the payback method would rank system III above systems I and II,
due to its shorter payback period. However, suppose we add another piece of information.
System III’s useful life is only two years, and it has no salvage value after two years. It is
true that system III will “pay back” its initial investment in only two years if we ignore the
time value of money. But then what? System III provides no further benefits beyond year 2.
In spite of system III’s short payback period, it is not a desirable investment proposal. The
NPV of system III, $(1,584), is negative [$(1,584) ! (1.736 " $6,000) # $12,000].
Payback Period with Uneven Cash Flows The simple payback formula
given on page 711 will not work if a project exhibits an uneven pattern of cash flows.
Instead, the after-tax cash flows must be accumulated on a year-to-year basis until the
accumulation equals the initial investment. Suppose High Country Department Stores’
management is considering the expansion of the downtown store’s parking facilities.
Management expects that the additional parking will result in much greater sales initially.
However, this benefit will gradually taper off, due to the reactions of competitors. The
projected after-tax cash flows are shown in Exhibit 16–13 , which also presents the pay-
back calculation for the parking lot proposal. The project’s payback period is five years.
Payback: Pro and Con In summary, the payback method of evaluating invest-
ment proposals has two serious drawbacks. First, the method fails to consider the time
value of money. Second, it does not consider a project’s cash flows beyond the pay-back
period. Despite these shortcomings, the payback method is used widely in practice, for
two legitimate reasons.
First, the payback method provides a tool for roughly screening investment propos-
als. If a project does not meet some minimal criterion for the payback period, manage-
ment may wish to reject the proposal regardless of potential large cash flows predicted
well into the future. Second, a young firm may experience a shortage of cash. For
such a company, it may be crucial to select investment projects that recoup their initial
investment quickly. A cash-poor firm may not be able to wait for the big payoff of a
project with a long payback period. Even in these cases, it is wise not to rely on the
payback method alone. If the payback method is used, it should be in conjunction with a
discounted-cash-flow analysis.
Accounting-Rate-of-Return Method
Discounted-cash-flow methods of investment analysis focus on cash flows and incorpo-
rate the time value of money. The accounting-rate-of-return method focuses on the
incremental a ccounting income that results from a project. Accounting income is based
on accrual accounting procedures. Revenue is recognized during the period of sale, not
necessarily when the cash is received; expenses are recognized during the period they are
incurred, not necessarily when they are paid in cash. The following formula is used to
compute the accounting rate of return on an investment project.

in its downtown store. The required equipment and furnishings cost $210,000 and are in
the MACRS 7-year property class. The company has elected to use the optional straight-
line depreciation method with the half-year convention. The Excel spreadsheet shown
in Exhibit 16–14 displays management’s revenue and expense projections for the lunch
counter. The total income projected over the project’s 10-year useful life is $174,000.
Thus, the average annual income is $17,400. The accounting rate of return on the lunch-
counter proposal is computed as follows:
$17,400
Accounting rate of return ! _ _______ ! 8.3% (rounded)
$210,000
To compute the lunch-counter project’s internal rate of return, let’s assume that each
year’s sales revenue, cost of goods sold, operating expenses, and income taxes are cash
flows in the same year that they are recorded under accrual accounting. Recall that the
depreciation expense is not a cash flow. These assumptions imply the following cash-
flow pattern for the project.

5 ................................................... 42,000 10 ................................... 30,000
The internal rate of return on the lunch-counter proposal is approximately 13.5 per-
cent. That is, if we compute the present value of the cash flows using a discount rate of
13.5 percent, we obtain approximately a zero NPV.3 Notice that the project’s accounting
rate of return, at 8.3 percent, is much lower than its IRR of 13.5 percent.
3 You can verify the IRR of 13.5% using Table III in Appendix A. You will need to interpolate to find the discount
factors for 13.5%, which lie between the 12% and 14% discount factors. For example, .881 is the approximate dis-
count factor for 13.5% and n ! 1 [.881 ! .877 $ (.25)(.893 # .877)]. Alternatively, you can calculate the discount
factor for 13.5% using the formula given in Table III.

Use of the Average Investment Some managers prefer to compute the

accounting rate of return is 20.7 percent. (The average annual income of $17,400 divided
by the average investment of $84,000 equals 20.7 percent, rounded.)
Notice that this modified version of the accounting rate of return yields a signifi-
cantly higher return than the project’s internal rate of return, which we computed as 13.5
percent. As a general rule of thumb, the following relationships will be observed.

Accounting Rate of Return: Pro and Con Like the payback method, the
accounting-rate-of-return method is a simple way of screening investment proposals.
Some managers use this method because they believe it parallels financial account-
ing statements, which also are based on accrual accounting. However, like the pay-
back method, the accounting-rate-of-return method does not consider the time value
of money.
Inconsistent Terminology Many different terms for the accounting rate of return
are used in practice. Among these terms are s imple rate of return, rate of return on assets,
and the unadjusted rate of return.
Estimating Cash Flows: The Role of Activity-Based Costing
The validity of any discounted-cash-flow analysis is dependent on the accuracy of the
Learning Objective 9
cash-flow estimates. Activity-based-costing (ABC) systems generally improve the ability
of an analyst to estimate the cash flows associated with a proposed project. By separating Describe the impact of activity-
costs into activity cost pools and identifying a cost driver for each pool, the analyst can based costing and advanced

is implemented. Costs that are treated as fixed under a traditional, volume-based costing capital-budgeting decisions.
system often are seen to be variable, with respect to the appropriate cost driver, under an
ABC system.4
Accuracy in estimating cash flows is particularly important in evaluating a proposed
investment in advanced manufacturing equipment. These decisions are complex, involv-
ing many peripheral cash flows besides the actual purchase of the equipment. Flexible
manufacturing systems (FMSs) generally require cash outlays for software, retraining
of employees, realignment of the production line, and engineering. The benefits of such
systems often are difficult to quantify also. Intangible benefits such as greater production
flexibility are important considerations in making these investment decisions.
In today’s manufacturing environment, it is crucial that companies make the best
decisions possible regarding huge investments such as those in flexible manufacturing
systems. Flawed decisions can spell disaster in today’s globally competitive arenas.
Justification of Investments in Advanced
Manufacturing Systems
The manufacturing industry is changing dramatically as firms adopt a just-in-time (JIT)
Learning Objective 9
inventory management approach and move toward computer-integrated-manufacturing
(CIM) systems. Many firms have found that JIT and CIM, coupled with a revised mana- Describe the impact of activity-
gerial accounting system, have provided a competitive edge in the marketplace. In many based costing and advanced
cases, however, managers have been frustrated when an NPV analysis projects a negative manufacturing technology on
net present value for a proposed investment in a CIM system. Managers often believe capital-budgeting decisions.
4 Activity-based-costing systems are covered extensively in Chapter 5.

intuitively that such an investment is justified, but they are stymied when the NPV analy-
sis points to rejection of the proposal.
What is the problem here? Are managers overly optimistic about the advantages
of CIM? Or is the NPV approach inappropriate for such an investment decision? Most
likely neither of these conjectures is true. Managers often are right when their intu-
ition tells them that the company would benefit from advanced manufacturing tech-
nology. And it is difficult to find fault with the NPV investment decision model. It
is economically and mathematically sound. The problem lies in the difficulties of
applying the NPV approach in a CIM investment decision. Some of these difficulties
are listed here.5

Chapter 16 Capital Expenditure Decisions 717
1. Hurdle rates that are too high. Sometimes managers have a tendency to set
hurdle rates that are too high in a CIM investment analysis. They tend to forget
that the purpose of discounting in the NPV model is to account for the time
value of money. The appropriate hurdle rate for any investment decision is the
investment opportunity rate for alternative investment projects of equivalent
risk. In many cases managers tend to overstate this rate.
2. Time horizons that are too short. Another common mistake is to evaluate a
CIM investment proposal with too short a time horizon. The acquisition cost
of a CIM system can be enormous, and the benefits may be realized over a
lengthy period of time.
3. Bias toward incremental projects. Most firms require that large investments
be authorized by managers at higher levels than are required for smaller
investments. One result of this sensible practice is an incentive for lower-
level managers to request relatively small, incremental improvements in the
manufacturing process rather than a large, comprehensive improvement, such
as a move to CIM. In many cases, a series of such incremental improvements
will not bring about the benefits that could be attained with a full commitment
to advanced manufacturing technology.
4. Greater uncertainty about operating cash flows. Managers often have
greater uncertainty about the cash flows that will result when an advanced
manufacturing system is implemented. This increased uncertainty is due to the
complexity of the machinery and the firm’s inexperience with such advanced
technology.
5. Exclusion of benefits that are difficult to quantify. The benefits to the firm from
JIT and CIM systems are extensive. Some are easy to estimate, such as lower
inventory levels, less floor space, and improved product quality. Others that can
be even more significant are often difficult to quantify. Some of these benefits
are listed below.
a. Greater flexibility in the production process. A flexible manufacturing
system cell often can produce runs of several distinct products in the same
day. Flexible manufacturing systems also allow engineering changes
to be made more easily as products are adapted to changing customer
preferences.
b. Shorter cycle times and reduced lead times are possible with an FMS. This
enables the firm to fill customer orders more quickly.
c. Reduction of non-value-added costs often results when JIT and FMS
systems are adopted. Part of the philosophy of these systems is to encour-
age employees to seek out activities that can be made more efficient or
eliminated.
d. Reduced inventory levels result in savings on working capital investment,
less storage space, and reduced obsolescence.
e. Lower floor-space requirements in a flexible manufacturing system require
less space than several stand-alone machines.
f. Product quality becomes higher and more constant because of advanced
manufacturing systems.
Although it is difficult to quantify these benefits, few managers doubt their existence.
Excluding them from an NPV analysis means they are being valued at zero. In many
cases it would be preferable to make some estimate of these benefits, however crude
it may be, than to ignore them. If a manager believes it is impossible to make such an
estimate, then the investment criteria should be expanded to consider these intangible
benefits along with a proposal’s NPV.

718 Chapter 16 Capital Expenditure Decisions
Chapter Summary
LO1 Use the net-present-value method and the internal-rate-of-return method to evaluate an
investment proposal. Under the net-present-value method, an investment proposal should be accepted
if its net present value is zero or positive. A project’s net present value is the present value of the project’s
future cash flows, less its initial acquisition cost. In computing the present value of the cash flows, the
discount rate is the organization’s cost of acquiring investment capital. Under the internal-rate-of-return
method, an investment proposal should be accepted if its internal rate of return equals or exceeds the
organization’s hurdle rate. A project’s internal rate of return is the discount rate required to make the
project’s net present value equal to zero.
LO2 Compare the net-present-value and internal-rate-of-return methods, and state the assumptions
underlying each method. The net-present-value method is somewhat easier to apply. It also has the
advantage of allowing the decision maker to adjust the discount rate upward for highly uncertain cash
flows. Both the net-present-value method and the internal-rate-of-return method are based on important
assumptions, including the following: (1) All cash flows are assumed to occur at year-end. (2) Cash flow
amounts are assumed to be certain. (3) Cash flows are assumed to be reinvested immediately in another
return-generating project. (4) A perfect capital market is assumed.
LO3 Use both the total-cost approach and the incremental-cost approach to evaluate an invest-
ment proposal. Under the total-cost approach, all projects’ cash flows are included in the analysis at
their total amounts. Under the incremental-cost approach, the differences in each cash flow, between
alternatives, are included in the analysis.
LO4 Determine the after-tax cash flows in an investment analysis. For financial items that are both
cash flows and on the income statement, the cash flow is multiplied by 1 minus the tax rate to compute
the after-tax cash flow. For financial items that are not cash flows but are on the income statement, the
cash flow is multiplied by the tax rate to compute the relevant after-tax cash flow. For financial items
that are cash flows but are not on the income statement, the cash flow is multiplied by 1 to determine
the after-tax cash flow. (In other words, for these items, the cash flow is already on an after-tax basis.)
LO5 Use the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System to determine an asset’s depreciation
schedule for tax purposes. This tax-law-based depreciation schedule, known as MACRS, places every
asset in one of eight classes and then states the depreciation rate for each year in the asset’s depreciable life.
LO6 Evaluate an investment proposal using a discounted-cash-flow analysis, giving full consider-
ation to income-tax issues. For any organization subject to income taxes, the first step in a discounted-
cash-flow analysis is to determine the after-tax cash flows related to the investment proposal under
consideration. Then these after-tax cash flows are discounted in accordance with the net-present-value
method or the internal-rate-of-return method.
LO7 Discuss the difficulty of ranking investment proposals, and use the profitability index. No
valid method exists for ranking independent investment projects with positive net present values. In
theory, a ll projects with positive net present values should be accepted, because the returns expected for
the projects exceed the company’s cost of capital. Nevertheless, in practice, managers often do attempt
to rank investment projects. One commonly used criterion for such rankings is the profitability index,
which is defined as follows: present value of a project’s cash flows, exclusive of the initial investment,
divided by the project’s initial investment.
LO8 Use the payback method and accounting-rate-of-return method to evaluate capital invest-
ment projects. A project’s payback period is its initial investment divided by the annual after-tax cash
inflow. As explained in the chapter, for projects with uneven cash flows, the payback period requires
a more complex calculation. A project’s accounting rate of return is computed as follows: (the proj-
ect’s average incremental revenue minus its average incremental expenses, including depreciation and
income taxes) divided by the project’s initial investment. Since these methods do not account for the
time value of money, they are conceptually inferior to discounted-cash-flow methods. However, many
organizations use these methods in conjunction with the NPV or IRR method.
LO9 Describe the impact of activity-based costing and advanced manufacturing technology on
capital-budgeting decisions. The validity of any discounted-cash-flow analysis depends on the accu-
racy of the cash-flow estimates. Activity-based costing systems generally improve the cost analyst’s
ability to accurately estimate projects’ cash flows. Some observers argue that, for a variety of reasons,
discounted-cash-flow analyses tend to underestimate the benefits of investing in advanced manufacturing
technology.

LO10 Explain the impact of inflation on a capital-budgeting analysis (Appendix B). Inflation
(a decline in the purchasing power of a monetary unit) can be incorporated in a discounted-cash-flow
analysis in either of two ways: (1) The cash flows are measured in nominal dollars, and the nominal inter-
est rate is used to compute the nominal discount rate. (2) The cash flows are measured in real dollars, and
the real interest rate is used to compute the real discount rate.
Review Problems on Capital Expenditure Decisions
Problem 1
Bay City’s Department of Public Works (DPW) is considering the replacement of some machinery. This
machinery has zero book value but its current market value is $960. One possible alternative is to invest
in new machinery, which has a cost of $46,800. This new machinery would produce estimated annual
operating cash savings of $15,000. The estimated useful life of the new machinery is four years. The
DPW uses straight-line depreciation. The new machinery has an estimated salvage value of $2,400 at
the end of four years. The investment in the new machinery would require an additional investment in
working capital of $3,600, which would be recovered after four years.
If the DPW accepts this investment proposal, disposal of the old machinery and investment in the
new equipment will take place on December 31, 20x4. The cash flows from the investment will occur
during the calendar years 20x5 through 20x8.
Required: P repare a net-present-value analysis of the county DPW’s machinery replacement
decision. The city has a 10 percent hurdle rate.
Problem 2
River City Pool Company recently purchased a truck for $40,000. The first year’s depreciation was
$8,000. The truck driver’s salary in the first year of operation was $42,000.
Required: Show how each of the amounts mentioned above should be converted to an after-tax
amount. The company’s tax rate is 35 percent.

APPENDIX B TO CHAPTER 16
Impact of Inflation
Most countries have experienced inflation to some degree over the past 30 years. I nflation is defined as a
Learning Objective 10 decline in the general purchasing power of a monetary unit, such as a dollar, across time. Since capital-
Explain the impact of inflation budgeting decisions involve cash flows over several time periods, it is worthwhile to examine the impact
on a capital-budgeting analysis of inflation in capital-budgeting analyses.
(Appendix B). Inflation can be incorporated in a discounted-cash-flow analysis in either of two ways. Both
approaches yield correct results, but the analyst must be careful to be consistent in applying either
approach. The two approaches are distinguished by the use of either nominal or real interest rates and
dollars. These terms are defined below.
Interest Rates: Real or Nominal The real interest rate is the underlying interest rate, which includes
compensation to investors for the t ime value of money and the r isk of an investment. The n ominal inter-
est rate includes the real interest rate, plus an additional premium to compensate investors for inflation.
Suppose the real interest rate is 10 percent, and inflation of 5 percent is projected. Then the nominal
interest rate is determined as follows:6
Real interest rate .................................................................................................................................................. .10
Inflation rate ......................................................................................................................................................... .05
Combined effect (.10 " .05) ................................................................................................................................. .005
Nominal interest rate ............................................................................................................................................. .155
6 An alternative way to compute the nominal interest rate is: (1.10 " 1.05) # 1.00 ! .155.

Chapter 16 Capital Expenditure Decisions 723
Dollars: Real or Nominal A cash flow measured in n ominal dollars is the actual cash flow we observe.
For example, a particular model of automobile cost $10,000 in year 1 but it cost $12,155 in year 5. Both
the $10,000 cash flow in year 1 and $12,155 cash flow in year 5 are measured in n ominal dollars. A cash
flow measured in r eal dollars reflects an adjustment for the dollar’s purchasing power. The following table
shows the relationship between nominal and real dollars, assuming an inflation rate of 5 percent.
(a) (b) (c) ! (a) # (b)
Year Cash Flow in Nominal Dollars Price Index Cash Flow in Real Dollars
Year 1 .............. $10,000 ........................... 1.0000 ............... $10,000
Year 2 .............. 10,500 ........................... (1.05)1 ! 1.0500 ............... 10,000
Year 3 .............. 11,025 ........................... (1.05)2 ! 1.1025 ............... 10,000
Year 4 .............. 11,576 ........................... (1.05)3 ! 1.1576 ............... 10,000
Year 5 .............. 12,155 ........................... (1.05)4 ! 1.2155 ............... 10,000
As the table shows, cash flows in nominal dollars must be deflated, which means dividing by the price index,
to convert them to cash flows in real dollars. The real-dollar cash flows are expressed in year 1 dollars.
Two Capital-Budgeting Approaches under Inflation
A correct capital-budgeting analysis may be done using either of the following approaches.
1. Use cash flows measured in n ominal dollars and a nominal interest rate to determine the
nominal discount rate.
2. Use cash flows measured in r eal dollars and a real interest rate to determine the r eal discount rate.
To illustrate these two approaches, we will focus on an equipment-replacement decision faced by
the management of High Country Department Stores. The company operates an appliance-repair service
for the household appliances it sells. Management is considering the replacement of a sophisticated
piece of testing equipment used in repairing TVs and VCRs. The new equipment costs $5,000 and will
have no salvage value. Over its four-year life, the new equipment is expected to generate the cost savings HIGH COUNTRY

cash inflows, measured in n ominal dollars.

Year 4 2,100 1,260 740 296 1,556
Year 5 2,500 1,500 370 148 1,648
Approach 1: Nominal Dollars and Nominal Discount Rate Under this capital-budgeting approach,
we discount the nominal-dollar cash flows in the preceding table using the nominal discount rate of 15.5
percent. The net-present-value analysis is as follows:
(a) (b) (c) ! (a) $ (b)
Cash Flow in Discount Factor for Present
Year Nominal Dollars Nominal Discount Rate of 15.5% Value
Year 1 ............. $(5,000) ....................... 1.000 ............................... $(5,000)
Year 2 ............. 1,807 ........................ .8658 [1/(1.155)]* ............................... 1,564

Year 5 ............. 1,648 ........................ .5619 [1/(1.155)4] ............................... 926
Net present value ................................................................................................................................ $ 64
* The 15.5% discount factors are computed using the formula in Table III of Appendix A.

High Country’s management should purchase the new testing equipment, since its NPV is positive.
Approach 2: Real Dollars and Real Discount Rate Under this capital-budgeting approach, we first
convert the cash flows measured in nominal dollars to cash flows in real dollars, as follows:
(a) (c) ! (a) # (b)
After-Tax (b) After-Tax
Cash Flow in Price Cash Flow in
Year Nominal Dollars Index Real Dollars*

Year 3 ...................... 2,089 .................................... 1.1025 ................................. 1,895
Year 4 ...................... 1,556 .................................... 1.1576 ................................. 1,344
Year 5 ...................... 1,648 .................................... 1.2155 ................................. 1,356
* Real-dollar cash fl ows expressed in terms of year 1 dollars.
Now we discount the after-tax cash flows, measured in real dollars, using the real discount rate of
10 percent. The net-present-value analysis is shown below.
(a) (b) (c) ! (a) $ (b)
Cash Flow in Discount Factor for Present
Year Real Dollars Real Discount Rate of 10% Value
Year 1 ............... $(5,000) ............................... 1.000 ..................................... $(5,000)
Year 2 ............... 1,721 ................................ .909 ..................................... 1,564
Year 3 ............... 1,895 ................................ .826 ..................................... 1,565
Year 4 ............... 1,344 ................................ .751 ..................................... 1,009
Year 5 ............... 1,356 ................................ .683 ..................................... 926
Net present value .................................................................................................................................. $ 64
Notice that the new testing equipment’s NPV is the same under both capital-budgeting approaches.
Under both approaches, we conclude that High Country Department Stores should purchase the new
equipment.
Consistency Is the Key Either capital-budgeting approach will provide the correct conclusion, as
long as it is applied consistently. Use either nominal dollars and a nominal discount rate or real dollars
and a real discount rate. A common error in capital budgeting is to convert the after-tax cash flows to
real dollars, but then use the nominal discount rate. This faulty analysis creates a bias against acceptance
of worthwhile projects.
To illustrate, suppose High Country’s management had made this error in its testing-equipment
analysis. The following i ncorrect analysis is the result.

Year 5 1,356 ........................... .5619 .............................. 762

This inconsistent and incorrect analysis will lead High Country’s management to the wrong
conclusion.

use. To demolish them would cost $10,000 each. $(2,270,200)
The chief ranger is considering an alternative plan, which involves four fire-control stations located
on the perimeter of the state forest. Each station would require a six-person staff, with annual compen-
sation costs of $300,000. Other operating costs would be $110,000 per base. Building each perimeter
station would cost $200,000. The perimeter bases would need helicopters and other equipment costing
$500,000 per station. Half of the equipment from the interior stations could be used at the perimeter
stations. Therefore, only half of the equipment at the interior stations would be sold if the perimeter
stations were built.
The state uses a 10 percent hurdle rate for all capital projects.

the project is started. The equipment dealer is certain that the equipment will be operational during the $(312,000)

obtained in the first year. The company will incur a one-time expense of $30,000 to transfer production x
activities from the old equipment to the new equipment. No loss of sales will occur, however, because
the processing facility is large enough to install the new equipment without interfering with the opera-
tions of the current equipment. The equipment is in the MACRS 7-year property class. The firm would
depreciate the machinery in accordance with the MACRS depreciation schedule.
The current equipment has been fully depreciated. Management has reviewed its condition and
has concluded that it can be used an additional eight years. The company would receive $10,000, net of
removal costs, if it elected to buy the new equipment and dispose of its current equipment at this time.
The new equipment will have no salvage value at the end of its life. The company is subject to a 40 per-

5. The changeover of the manufacturing line will cost $90,000, to be expensed in 20x1.
6. Several employees will need retraining to operate the new robotic equipment. The training costs
are projected as follows:
20x1 ............................................................................. $35,000
20x2 ............................................................................. 25,000
20x3 ............................................................................. 10,000
7. An inventory of spare parts for the robotic equipment will be purchased immediately at a cost of
$60,000. This investment in working capital will be maintained throughout the eight-year life of
the equipment. At the end of 20x8, the parts will be sold for $60,000.
8. The robotic equipment’s salvage value at the end of 20x8 is projected to be $50,000. It will be
fully depreciated at that time.
9. Aside from the costs specifically mentioned above, management expects the robotic equipment to
save $480,000 per year in manufacturing costs.
10. Switching to the robotic equipment will enable Scientific Frontiers Corporation to sell some of its
manufacturing machinery over the next two years. The following sales schedule is projected.

the public, install caution signs in certain hazardous locations, and retrain its drivers.
A minibus costs $27,000, whereas a full-size bus costs $90,000. The school district uses straight-
line depreciation for all of its long-lived assets. The board has two options regarding the five full-size
buses. First, the buses could be sold now for $15,000 each. Second, the buses could be kept in reserve
to use for field trips and out-of-town athletic events and to use as backup vehicles when buses break
down. Currently, the board charters buses from a private company for these purposes. The annual cost
of chartering buses amounts to $30,000. The school district controller has estimated that this cost could
be cut to $5,000 per year if the five buses were kept in reserve. The five full-size buses have five years
of useful life remaining, either as regularly scheduled buses or as reserve buses. The useful life of a new
minibus is projected to be five years also.
Central Catskill School District uses a hurdle rate of 12 percent on all capital projects.
Required:
1. Think about the decision problem faced by the board of education. What are the board’s two main
alternatives?
2. One of these main alternatives has two options embedded within it. What are those two options?
3. Before proceeding, check the hint given at the end of the chapter, which explains and diagrams the
school board’s alternatives. Suppose the board of education chooses to buy the minibuses. Prepare
a net-present-value analysis of the two options for the five full-size buses. Should these buses be
sold now or kept in reserve?
4. From your answer to requirement (3), you know the best option for the board to choose regarding
the full-size buses if the minibuses are purchased. Now you can ignore the other option. Prepare
a net-present-value analysis of the school board’s two main alternatives: (a) continue to use the
full-size buses on regular routes or (b) purchase the minibuses. Should the minibuses be purchased?
5. Compute the internal rate of return on the proposed minibus acquisition.
6. What information given in this case was irrelevant to the school board’s decision problem? Explain
why the information was irrelevant.

7. Independent of requirements (1) through (6), suppose the NPV analysis favors keeping the full-size

to recommend that the board not purchase the minibuses. Before doing so, however, Jeffries ran
into a long-time friend at the racquet club. Peter Reynolds was the vice president for sales at a local
automobile dealership from which the minibuses would have been purchased. Jeffries broke the bad
news about his impending recommendation about the minibuses to his friend. The two talked for
some time about the pros and cons of the minibus alternative. Finally, Reynolds said, “Michael, you
and I go back a long time. I know you’re not paid all that well at the school district. Our top financial
person is retiring next year. How would you like to come to work for the dealership?”
“That’s pretty tempting, Peter. Let me think it over,” was Jeffries’ response.
“Sure, Michael, take all the time you want. In the meantime, how about rethinking that minibus
decision? It’s no big deal to you, and I could sure use the business.”
“But Peter, I told you what the figures say about that,” responded Jeffries.

20x3 ............................................................................... 52,000
20x4 ............................................................................... 55,000
20x5 ............................................................................... 55,000
The equipment used to manufacture the waste container must be replaced because it is broken and
cannot be repaired. Management is considering the purchase of robotic equipment to replace the old
machinery. The new equipment would have a purchase price of $945,000. There will be a 2 percent
discount if payment is made within 10 days. Company policy is to take all purchase discounts. The
freight on the equipment would be $11,000, and installation costs would total $22,900. Freight and
installation costs will be included in the equipment’s cost basis for MACRS depreciation purposes. The
equipment would be purchased in December of the current year and placed into service on January 1,
20x1. It would have a five-year useful life but would be treated as three-year property under MACRS
because of the nature of the equipment. This equipment is expected to have a salvage value of $12,000 at
the end of its useful life in 20x5. The new equipment will result in a 25 percent reduction in both direct
labor and variable overhead. There will be an additional one-time permanent decrease in working capital
requirements of $2,500, resulting from a reduction in direct-material inventories. This working capital
reduction would be recognized in the analysis at the time of equipment acquisition. The old equipment
is fully depreciated, and it can be sold for a salvage amount of $1,500.
Rather than replace the equipment, one of Office King’s production managers has suggested that
the waste containers be purchased. Office King has no alternative use for the manufacturing space at this
time, so if the waste containers are purchased, the old equipment would be left in place. One supplier
has quoted a price of $27 per container. This price is $8 less than Office King’s current manufacturing
cost, which is as follows:
Direct material .......................................................................................................... $ 8.00
Direct labor ............................................................................................................... 10.00
Variable overhead ..................................................................................................... 6.00

Chapter 16 Capital Expenditure Decisions 737
Office King employs a plantwide fixed overhead rate in its operations. If the waste containers
are purchased outside, the salary and benefits of one supervisor, included in the fixed overhead bud-
get at $45,000, would be eliminated. There would be no other changes in the other cash and noncash
items included in fixed overhead, except depreciation on the new equipment. Office King is subject to a
40 percent income tax rate. Management assumes that all annual cash flows and tax payments occur at
the end of the year and uses a 12 percent after-tax discount rate.
Required:
1. Office King must decide whether to purchase the waste containers from an outside supplier or
purchase the equipment to manufacture the waste containers. Calculate the net present value of the
estimated after-tax cash flows and determine which of these two options to pursue.
2. Explain why some companies calculate the payback period of an investment in addition to
determining the net present value.
3. Between what two consecutive whole number amounts is the payback period for the new
equipment?

Hint for Case 16–59
The school board’s two main alternatives are as follows: (1) continue to use the five full-size buses on
regular routes or (2) purchase eight minibuses to cover the regular bus routes. Under alternative (2), the
board has two options. The full-size buses could be ( a) sold now or (b) kept in reserve.
Thus, the board’s decision problem can be diagrammed as follows:
Main Alternatives Secondary Options
(1) Full-size buses on regular routes
(a) Sell full-size buses
(2) Minibuses on regular routes
(b) Keep full-size buses in reserve

FOCUS COMPANY >>>
THIS CHAPTER’S FOCUS COMPANY is Riverside Clinic, an outpatient medical RIVERSIDE
facility in Louisville, Kentucky. The clinic has two direct-patient-care departments: CLINIC
Orthopedics and Internal Medicine. In these two departments, patients
are treated by medical professionals. Riverside Clinic also has three
service departments, which are not directly involved in patient care.
The clinic’s Patient Records, Human Resources, and Administra-
tion and Accounting departments are necessary for the clinic
to function, but they operate in a support role to the two
direct-patient-care departments. In this chapter, we explore
several methods for allocating the costs of the clinic’s ser-
vice departments to the direct-patient-care departments.

IN CONTRAST >>>
In contrast to the health-care services setting of Riverside Clinic, we
explore a different type of allocation issue in the context of International
Chocolate Company. This company uses a joint production process to turn cocoa beans
into cocoa butter and cocoa powder. The cocoa powder can be processed further into
instant cocoa mix. A joint production process results in two or more products, which are
called joint products. We will discuss several different methods that International Choco-
late Company could use to allocate the costs of its joint production process to its two joint
products.

AFTER COMPLETING THIS CHAPTER, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
1 Allocate service department costs using the direct method and the step-down
method.
2 Use the dual approach to service department cost allocation.
3 Explain the difference between two-stage cost allocation with departmental
overhead rates and activity-based costing (ABC).
4 Allocate joint costs among joint products using each of the following techniques:
physical-units method, relative-sales-value method, and net-realizable-value
method.
5 Describe the purposes for which joint cost allocation is useful and those for which
it is not.
6 Allocate service department costs using the reciprocal-services method
(appendix).
In earlier chapters, we studied cost allocation and explored its role in an organization’s
overall managerial accounting system. We also examined several purposes of cost alloca-
tion. The goal of cost allocation is to ensure that all costs incurred by the organization
ultimately are assigned to its products or services. This is important for several purposes,
including cost-based pricing and bidding, cost reimbursements from outside parties such
as insurance companies, valuation of inventory, and determination of cost of goods sold. In
addition, the allocation of all costs to departments serves to make departmental managers
aware of the costs incurred to produce services their departments use.
This chapter is divided into two sections, each of which explores a particular
costallocation topic in greater detail. The two sections, which may be studied separately,
cover the following topics:
• Service department cost allocation1
• Joint product cost allocation2
Section 1: Service Department Cost Allocation
A service department is a unit in an organization that is not involved d irectly in produc-

down. Thus, the Maintenance Department is crucial to the production operation even
though the repair personnel do not work directly on the plant’s products.

the rest of the chapter. This material may be studied after the completion of Chapter 3, which covers basic issues in
product costing.
2 The section on joint cost allocation is written as a module, which can be studied separately from the rest of the
chapter. This material may be studied after the completion of Chapter 3.

Chapter 17 Allocation of Support Activity Costs and Joint Costs 741
Service departments are important in nonmanufacturing organizations also. For
example, a hospital’s Human Resources Department is responsible for staffing the hospi-
tal with physicians, nurses, lab technicians, and other employees. The Human Resources
Department never serves the patients, yet without it the hospital would have no staff to
provide medical care.
A service department such as the Maintenance Department or the Human Resources
Department must exist in order for an organization to carry out its primary function.
Therefore, the cost of running a service department is part of the cost incurred by the
organization in producing goods or services. In order to determine the cost of those goods
or services, all service department costs must be allocated to the production depart-
ments in which the goods or services are produced. For this reason, the costs incurred
in an automobile plant’s Maintenance Department are allocated to all of the production
departments that have machinery. The costs incurred in a hospital’s Human Resources
Department are allocated to all of the departments that have personnel. Direct-patient-
care departments, such as Surgery and Physical Therapy, are allocated their share of the
Human Resources Department’s costs.
To see how service department cost allocation fits into the overall picture of product
and service costing, it may be helpful to review Exhibit 3–12 on page 105. The exhibit
shows three types of allocation processes, as follows:
1. C ost distribution. Costs in various cost pools are distributed to all departments,
including both service and production departments.
2. Service department cost allocation. Service department costs are allocated to
production departments.
3. Cost application. Costs are assigned to the goods or services produced by the
organization.
It is the second type of allocation process listed above that we are focusing on RIVERSIDE
now. The context for our discussion is Riverside Clinic, an outpatient medical facility in
Louisville, Kentucky. CLINIC
The clinic is organized into three service departments and two direct-patient-care
departments. E xhibit 17–1 displays a simple organization chart for Riverside Clinic.
Since the clinic is not a manufacturing organization, we refer to direct-patient-care
departments instead of production departments. These two departments, Orthopedics and “Support, or service, depart-

bases, which are used to determine the proportions shown in panel A. Further explanation
of the information in Exhibit 17–2 follows.
Patient Records The service output of the Patient Records Department is consumed
only by the Orthopedics and Internal Medicine Departments. Annual patient load is the
allocation base used to determine that 30 percent of the Patient Records Department’s
services were consumed by Orthopedics and 70 percent by Internal Medicine.
Human Resources The Human Resources Department serves each of the clinic’s
other departments, including the other two service departments and the two direct-
patient-care departments. The a llocation base used to determine the proportions of the
Human Resources Department’s output consumed by the four using departments is the
number of employees in the using departments. For example, 5 percent of the clinic’s
employees (excluding those in the Human Resources Department) work in the Patient
Records Department.
Administration and Accounting This service department provides services
only to the Human Resources Department, the Orthopedics Department, and the Inter-
nal Medicine Department. A variety of services are provided, such as computer support,
patient billing, and general administration. Since greater amounts of these services are
provided to the larger departments, departmental size is the allocation base used to deter-
mine the proportion of service output consumed by each department. Since the space
devoted to each department is a convenient measure of departmental size, square footage

Chapter 17 Allocation of Support Activity Costs and Joint Costs 743
is the measure used in Exhibit 17–2 . For example, 5 percent of the clinic’s space (exclud-
ing that occupied by Administration and Accounting and Patient Records) is devoted to
the Human Resources Department.
Panel C of Exhibit 17–2 shows the total budgeted cost of each service department
that is to be allocated among the using departments.
There are two widely used methods of service department cost allocation, the direct
method and the step-down method. These methods are discussed and illustrated next,
using the data for Riverside Clinic.
Direct Method
Under the d irect method, each service department’s costs are allocated among o nly the
direct-patient-care departments that consume part of the service department’s output.
This method ignores the fact that some service departments provide services to other
service departments. Thus, even though Riverside Clinic’s Human Resources Depart-
ment provides services to two other service departments, none of its costs are allocated
to those departments. Exhibit 17–3 presents Riverside Clinic’s service department cost
allocations under the direct method.
Notice that the proportion of each service department’s costs to be allocated to each
direct-patient-care department is determined by the r elative proportion of the service
department’s output consumed by each direct-patient-care department. For example, a
glance at Exhibit 17–2 shows that the Human Resources Department provides 25 per-
cent of its services to Orthopedics and 50 percent to Internal Medicine. Summing these
two percentages yields 75 percent. Thus, 25/75 is the fraction of the Human Resources
Department’s cost allocated to Orthopedics and 50/75 is the fraction allocated to Internal
Medicine.
Step-Down Method
As stated above, the direct method ignores the provision of services by one service
department to another service department. This shortcoming is overcome partially by the
step-down method of service department cost allocation. Under this method, the mana-
gerial accountant first chooses a sequence in which to allocate the service departments’
costs. A common way to select the first service department in the sequence is to choose
the one that serves the largest number of other service departments. The service depart-
ments are ordered in this manner, with the last service department being the one that
serves the smallest number of other service departments. 3 Then the managerial accountant

3 A tie occurs when two or more service departments serve the same number of other service departments. Then the
sequence among the tied service departments usually is an arbitrary choice.

744 Chapter 17 Allocation of Support Activity Costs and Joint Costs
allocates each service department’s costs among the direct-patient-care departments and
all of the other service departments that follow it in the sequence. Note that the ultimate
cost allocations assigned to the direct-patient-care departments will differ depending on
the sequence chosen.
The step-down method is best explained by way of an illustration. Riverside Clinic’s
Human Resources Department serves two other service departments: Patient Records,
and Administration and Accounting. The Administration and Accounting Department
serves only one other service department: Human Resources. Finally, the Patient Records
Department serves no other service departments. Thus, Riverside Clinic’s service depart-
ment sequence is as follows:
(1) (2) (3)
Human Administration Patient
Resources and Accounting Records
In accordance with this sequence, each service department’s costs are allocated to the
other departments as follows:

Patient Records ............................................................................................................... Orthopedics

Internal Medicine
Notice that even though Administration and Accounting serves Human Resources,
there is no cost allocation in that direction. This results from the placement of Human
Resources before Administration and Accounting in the allocation sequence. Moreover,
no costs are allocated from Patient Records to either of the other service departments,
because Patient Records does not serve those departments.
Exhibit 17–4 presents the results of applying the step-down method at Riverside
Clinic. First, the Human Resources Department’s $60,000 in cost is allocated among the
four departments using its services. Second, the cost of the Administration and Account-
ing Department is allocated. The total cost to be allocated is the department’s original
$190,000 p lus the $12,000 allocated from the Human Resources Department. The new
total of $202,000 is allocated to the Orthopedics and Internal Medicine Departments
according to the relative proportions in which these two departments use the services
of the Administration and Accounting Department. Finally, the Patient Records Depart-
ment’s cost is allocated.
Reciprocal-Services Method
The direct method and the step-down method both ignore the fact that the Administration
and Accounting Department serves the Human Resources Department. Neither of these
methods allocates any of the costs incurred in Administration and Accounting back to
Human Resources.
Review the relationships between the service departments depicted in Exhibit 17–1 .
Notice that the Administration and Accounting Department and the Human Resources
Department serve each other. This mutual provision of service is called reciprocal
service. A more accurate method of service department cost allocation, called the

RIVERSIDE
Fixed versus Variable Costs CLINIC
In our allocation of Riverside Clinic’s service department costs, we did not distinguish
between fixed and variable costs. Under some circumstances, this simple approach can
result in an unfair cost allocation among the using departments. To illustrate, we will use
the data about Riverside Clinic’s fixed and variable costs given in panel C of Exhibit 17–2 .
Consider the cost data for the Patient Records Department, which serves only the Ortho-
pedics and Internal Medicine departments. Under the d irect method of service depart-
ment cost allocation, the Patient Records Department’s costs were allocated as follows:
Cost Allocation for 20x1: Direct Method
Patient Records Orthopedics
Variable cost . . . . . . . . . . . .$ 24,000 ($100,000)(3/10) = $30,000
Fixed cost . .. . . . . . . . . . . . 76,000
Total cost . . . . . . . . . . . . .$100,000
Internal Medicine
($100,000)(7/10) = $70,000
The allocation base used in this cost allocation is the annual patient load in the
Orthopedics and Internal Medicine departments. Let’s assume the following patient loads
in 20x1, the year for which the cost allocation has been done.
Department Patient Load Proportion of Total
Orthopedics ................................................... 30,000 ............................................... (30,000/100,000) ! 3/10
Internal Medicine ........................................... 70,000 ............................................... (70,000/100,000) ! 7/10
Total .............................................................. 100,000 ...............................................

746 Chapter 17 Allocation of Support Activity Costs and Joint Costs
Now suppose the projections for 20x2 are as follows:
Department Projected Patient Load Projected Proportion of Total
Orthopedics .......................................... 30,000 ............................................. (30,000/80,000) ! 3/8
Internal Medicine .................................. 50,000 ............................................. (50,000/80,000) ! 5/8
Total ..................................................... 80,000
Department Budgeted Variable Cost Budgeted Fixed Cost Budgeted Total Cost
Patient Records .............. $19,200 ........................... $76,000 ............................. $95,200
The projections for 20x2 include a stable patient load in the Orthopedics Department but
a decline in the patient load of the Internal Medicine Department. Since the projected
total patient load is lower for 20x2, the projected variable cost in the Patient Records
Department is lower also.
What will be the effect of these changes on the 20x2 allocation of the Patient Records
Department’s costs? Using the direct method, we obtain the following allocation.
Cost Allocation for 20x2: Direct Method
Patient Records Orthopedics
Variable cost . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 19,200 ($95,200)(3/8) = $35,700
Fixed cost . .. . . . . . . . . . . . 76,000
Total cost . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 95,200
Internal Medicine
($95,200)(5/8) = $59,500
Compare the costs allocated to the two direct-patient-care departments in 20x1 and
20x2. Notice that the cost allocated to the Orthopedics Department increased by $5,700
(from $30,000 to $35,700), even though Orthopedics’ patient load is projected to remain
constant. What has happened here? The projected decline in the Internal Medicine
Department’s volume resulted in lower budgeted variable costs for the Patient Records
Department, but the budgeted fixed costs did not change. At the same time, the lower
projected patient load in Internal Medicine resulted in a higher proportion of the total
projected patient load for Orthopedics (from 3/10 in 20x1 up to 3/8 in 20x2). As the fol-
lowing analysis shows, this results in an increased allocation of fixed costs to the Ortho-
pedics Department in 20x2.
20x1 20x2
Fixed cost in Patient Records Department ........................................................................ $76,000 $76,000
Orthopedics Department’s proportion of total patient load ................................................. 3/10 3/8
Orthopedics Department’s allocation of fixed cost ............................................................ $22,800 $28,500
Difference ! $5,700
          
This difference of $5,700 is equal to the increase in the Orthopedics Department’s total
cost allocation from the Patient Records Department in 20x2.
To summarize, the projected decline in Internal Medicine’s 20x2 patient load
will result in an increased cost allocation from the Patient Records Department to the
Orthopedics Department in 20x2. The cause of this increased allocation is our failure to
distinguish between fixed and variable costs in the allocation process.

COST MANAGEMENT IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY A ccounting
Medicare uses a payment system based on diagnosis related groups (DRG) to control P ractice
soaring health care costs. Under this system, a flat amount of fees is paid to a health
Medicare
care provider for a given category of illness (per case or DRG). Managed care plans
have emerged to integrate financing and delivery of health care services and to provide
health care in a cost-effective manner. Under managed care plans, treatment providers
receive a fixed payment per plan member (patient) regardless of the treatments provided
or resources consumed by individual plan members. In such a challenging environment,
accurate costing of health care services and cost management have become critically
important for health care providers to remain profitable under the fixed payment plans.
An appropriate cost system can help reduce treatment cost distortion, increase cost
effectiveness, and improve decision making in the health care industry.
Dual Cost Allocation
The problem illustrated in the preceding section can be resolved by allocating fixed and
Learning Objective 2
variable costs separately. This approach, called d ual cost allocation, works with either
the direct method or the step-down method of allocation. Under dual cost allocation, Use the dual approach to
variable costs are allocated on the basis of s hort-run usage of the service department’s service department cost
output; f ixed costs are allocated on the basis of long-run average usage of the service allocation.
department’s output. The rationale for this approach is that fixed costs are capacity-
producing costs. When service departments are established, their size and scale usually
are determined by the projected long-run needs of the using departments.
To illustrate dual cost allocation for Riverside Clinic, we need estimates of the long-
run average usage of each service department’s output by each using department. These
estimates are given in Exhibit 17–5 .
To combine the dual-allocation approach with either the direct method or the step-
down method, we simply apply the allocation method twice, as follows:

After both of these allocation procedures have been completed, the resulting
variable- and fixed-cost allocations for each direct-patient-care department are summed.
Exhibit 17–6 presents the allocation computations when the dual approach is combined
with the direct method. Compare the final direct allocations with those in Exhibit 17–3 ,
where the dual approach was not used. Notice that the final allocations are different.
Exhibit 17–7 presents the computations for the step-down method. Compare the final
step-down allocations with those in Exhibit 17–4 , where the dual approach was not used.
Again, the final allocations are different.
A Behavioral Problem Dual cost allocation prevents a change in the short-
run activity of one using department from affecting the cost allocated to another using
department. However, the approach sometimes presents a problem of its own. In order
to implement the technique, we need accurate projections of the long-run average usage
of each service department’s output by each using department. This is the information
in Exhibit 17–5 . Typically, these estimates come from the managers of the departments
that consume the services. The problem is that the higher a manager’s estimate of the
department’s long-run average usage is, the greater will be the department’s allocation of
fixed service department costs. This creates an incentive for using-department managers
to understate their expected long-run service needs. Ultimately, such understatements can
result in building service facilities that are too small.
How can we prevent this behavioral problem? First, we can rely on the profession-
“Our clients are realizing to alism and integrity of the managers who provide the estimates. Second, we can reward
an ever-greater extent that managers through promotions and pay raises for making accurate estimates of their

and manage their support
service costs.” (17c)
Allocate Budgeted Costs
American Management
Systems When service department costs are allocated to production departments, such as the
direct-patient-care departments of Riverside Clinic, b udgeted service department costs
should be used. If actual costs are allocated instead, any operating inefficiencies in the
service departments are passed along to the using departments. This reduces the incen-
tive for service department managers to control the costs in their departments. The proper
approach is as follows:

Today’s Advanced Manufacturing Environment
In traditional manufacturing environments, service department costs are allocated to pro-
duction departments to ensure that all manufacturing costs are assigned to products. For
example, the costs incurred in a machine-maintenance department typically are allocated
to the other service departments and the production departments that use maintenance
services. Service department cost allocation continues to be used in the new manufactur-
ing environment, characterized by JIT inventory management and CIM systems. How-
ever, the extent of such allocations is diminished in advanced manufacturing systems,
because more costs are directly traceable to product lines. In a flexible manufacturing
system, almost all operations are performed in the FMS cell. Even machine maintenance
is done largely by the FMS cell operators rather than a separate maintenance department.
Inspection often is performed by FMS cell operators, eliminating the need for a separate
inspection department. In short, as more and more costs become directly traceable to
products, the need for allocation of indirect costs declines.

750 Chapter 17 Allocation of Support Activity Costs and Joint Costs
The Rise of Activity-Based Costing
Service department cost allocation is one type of allocation procedure used in two-stage
Learning Objective 3
allocation with departmental overhead rates. (See Exhibit 3–12 on page 105). Under this
Explain the difference between approach, costs first are distributed to departments; then they are allocated from ser-
two-stage cost allocation with vice d epartments to production d epartments. Finally, they are assigned from production

and activity-based costing objects under this approach.
(ABC). In an activity-based costing (ABC) system, on the other hand, the key role is played
by activities, not departments. (See Exhibit 5–4 on page 173). First, the costs of various
activities are assigned to activity cost pools; then these costs are assigned to products or
services.
The breakdown of costs by activity in an ABC system is much finer than a breakdown
by departments. For example, under the service department cost allocation approach,
the Purchasing Department might be one of the service departments identified. How-
ever, under ABC, the various activities engaged in by purchasing personnel would be
separately identified. Activities such as part specification, vendor identification, vendor
selection, price negotiation, ordering, expediting, receiving, inspection, and invoice pay-
ing might be identified separately under ABC. Then the costs of each of these activities
would be assigned to products or services on the basis of the appropriate cost drivers. The
ABC approach generally will provide a much more accurate cost for each of the organi-
zation’s products or services.4
Section 2: Joint Product Cost Allocation
A joint production process results in two or more products, which are termed joint

products can be sold at the split-off point or processed further. Cocoa butter can be sepa-
rately processed into a sun screen, and cocoa powder can be separately processed into
instant cocoa mix.

For product-costing purposes, a joint product cost usually is allocated to the joint products
that result from the joint production process. Such allocation is necessary for inventory
valuation and income determination, among other reasons.5 As we discussed in Chapter
14, however, joint cost allocation is n ot useful for making substantive economic decisions
about the joint process or the joint products. For example, Chapter 14 shows that joint
cost allocation is not useful in deciding whether to process a joint product further. (See
pages 607–609.) There are three commonly used methods for allocating joint product Learning Objective 5

A ccounting JOINT COST ALLOCATION IN THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY
P ractice One of the most complicated problems in joint cost allocation routinely occurs in the
petroleum industry. When an oil company, such as ExxonMobil, drills a successful oil well,
ExxonMobil
the well almost always produces natural gas in addition to crude oil. Moreover, the crude
oil produced by a typical oil well is of various grades. Lighter crude oils suitable for pro-
duction of such products as gasoline are generally near the top of an oil reservoir, while
the heavier crudes are near the bottom. The heavier crude oils are used to make such
products as fuel oil for heating homes and businesses and for the generation of electricity.
All of these products obtained from a successful oil well are joint products: the vari-
ous grades of crude oil and the natural gas. Most of these products will require further
processing before they will be salable products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, or home
heating oil. Thus, substantial separable costs will be incurred in processing the joint prod-
ucts in addition to the joint costs incurred in the oil field operations. Millions of dollars of
joint costs are incurred in the development of an off-shore oil field. The costs of locating
the oil field, building the drilling platforms, and the drilling itself are all joint costs. Then
there are the costs of crewing the oil rigs and the ongoing costs of bringing oil and natural
gas to the surface.
Oil companies such as ExxonMobil typically use the net realizable value of the prod-
ucts manufactured as the basis for allocating the joint production costs. The full costs
of the company’s various products then become the basis for pricing and product-mix
decisions.
The next time you pump gas for your automobile, think about the salaries of the
helicopter pilots who bring food and other supplies to the many off-shore oil platforms.
Those costs comprise a part of the joint cost allocated to the gasoline you obtain from
the pump.

realizable value of each final product is its sales value less any separable costs incurred
after the split-off point. The joint cost is allocated according to the relative magnitudes
of the final products’ net realizable values. Panel C of Exhibit 17–9 illustrates this
allocation method.
Notice how different the cost allocations are under the three methods, particularly the
physical-units method. Since the physical-units approach is not based on the e conomic
characteristics of the joint products, it is the least preferred of the three methods.

Chapter Summary
LO1 Allocate service department costs using the direct method and the step-down method. Under
the direct method, the costs of each service department are allocated directly to each production depart-
ment in proportion to each production department’s usage of each service department’s output. Under the
step-down method, the service departments are first ranked by the number of other service departments
that each one serves. Then the costs of each service department in the ranked sequence are allocated among
all of the remaining service departments in the sequence together with all of the production departments.
LO2 Use the dual approach to service department cost allocation. Either the direct or the step-
down method may be combined with the dual-allocation approach, in which variable and fixed costs are
allocated separately.
LO3 Explain the difference between two-stage cost allocation with departmental overhead rates
and activity-based costing (ABC). Two-stage allocation with departmental overhead rates involves
the following three steps: (1) All overhead costs are allocated among all service and production depart-
ments. (2) Service-department costs are allocated to production departments. (3) Production department
costs are applied to products or services. In contrast, two-stage allocation under ABC involves the fol-
lowing two steps: (1) Resource costs are assigned to activity cost pools. (2) The costs in these activity
cost pools are assigned to cost objects (e.g., products or services) using appropriate cost drivers.
LO4 Allocate joint costs among joint products using each of the following techniques: physical
units method, relative-sales-value method, and net-realizable-value method. In the physical-units
method, the joint cost is allocated to the joint products in proportion to some physical characteristic
of the joint products, such as weight or volume. In the relative-sales-value method, the joint cost is
allocated to the joint products in proportion to the joint products’ sales values at the split-off point In
the net-realizable-value method, the joint cost is allocated to the joint products in proportion to the joint
products’ net realizable values.
LO5 Describe the purposes for which joint cost allocation is useful and those for which it is not.
Joint cost allocation is useful for product-costing purposes, but the allocated costs should not affect
substantive economic decisions.
LO6 Allocate service department costs using the reciprocal-services method (appendix). Under
the reciprocal-services method, simultaneous equations are specified to show how each service and
production department uses the services of the various service departments. When these equations are
solved simultaneously, the result is the amount of service department cost to be allocated to each pro-
duction department. Unlike the direct and step-down methods, the reciprocal-services method fully
accounts for all reciprocal services among service departments.

Review Problem on Service Department Cost Allocation
Renaissance School of Music and Art provides classes for school-age children. The students are enrolled
in two departments: Music Education and Art Education. The school also has two service departments:
Administration and Human Resources (A & HR) and Maintenance (M). The budgeted costs in the two
service departments are as follows:
Administration and Human Resources ............................................................................................................ $342,000
Maintenance ................................................................................................................................................. 171,000
The usage of the service department’s output for the year is as follows:

APPENDIX TO CHAPTER 17
Reciprocal-Services Method
The reciprocal-services method of service department cost allocation fully accounts for the mutual pro- RIVERSIDE
vision of services among all the service departments. The relationships between Riverside Clinic’s three
service departments are portrayed in the following diagram. CLINIC
Patient Records Human Resources Administration and Accounting
(Department R) (Department H) (Department A)
Learning Objective 6
Allocate service department
The first step in the technique is to specify a set of equations that express the relationships between
costs using the reciprocal
the departments. The following equations, which express these relationships for Riverside Clinic, are
services method (appendix).
based on the data in Exhibit 17–2 on page 742.
R ! 100,000 " .05H (1)
H ! 60,000 " .05A (2)
A ! 190,000 " .20H (3)
where R d enotes the total cost of the Patient Records Department
H denotes the total cost of the Human Resources Department
A d enotes the total cost of the Administration and Accounting Department
Equation (1) says that the total cost of operating the Patient Records Department ( R ) is $100,000
plus 5 percent of the total cost of operating the Human Resources Department (H ). The $100,000 comes
from Exhibit 17–2 (panel C) and is the total cost t raceable to the Patient Records Department. We
add to this amount 5 percent of the total cost of operating the Human Resources Department. Why?
Because Exhibit 17–2 (panel A) tells us that the Patient Records Department used 5 percent of the
Human Resources Department’s services. Similar explanations underlie equations (2) and (3).
The second step in the reciprocal-services method is to solve the simultaneous equations. 6 Let’s begin
by substituting the expression for A from equation (3) into equation (2), and solving for H as follows:
H ! 60,000 " .05(190,000 " .20H)
! 60,000 " 9,500 " .01H
.99H ! 69,500
H ! 70,202 (rounded)
Then we substitute the value for H we just obtained into equation (3), and solve for A as follows:
A ! 190,000 " .20H
! 190,000 " (.20)(70,202)
! 204,040 (rounded)
6 Simultaneous equations are more quickly solved by computers than by people. Numerous software packages are
available for this purpose.

Exhibit 17–10
Reciprocal-Services Method
Now we can solve for R by substituting the value for H into equation (1) as follows:
of Service Department Cost
Allocation: Riverside Clinic R! 100,000 " .05H
RIVERSIDE ! 100,000 " (.05)(70,202)
! 103,510 (rounded)
CLINIC
Thus, we have determined that H ! 70,202, A ! 204,040, and R ! 103,510.
The final step in the reciprocal-services method is to allocate the t otal cost of operating each ser-
vice department (R , H, and A ) to the various departments that use its services. For example, we will
allocate the total cost of operating the Human Resources Department ( H ) among all four of Riverside
Clinic’s other departments, because they all use services from Human Resources. This allocation is
made in proportion to the use of Human Resources’s services by the other departments, as given in
Exhibit 17–2 (panel A).
The allocations are shown in Exhibit 17–10 . Focus on the second row of numbers, which refers to
the Human Resources Department. The $70,202 shown in parentheses in the Human Resources column
is that department’s total cost, as computed using the simultaneous equations. This $70,202 total cost is
allocated as follows:
• 20 percent (or $14,040) to Administration and Accounting, because that department uses 20
percent of the Human Resources Department’s services
• 5 percent (or $3,510) to Patient Records, because that department uses 5 percent of the Human
Resources Department’s services
• 25 percent (or $17,551) to Orthopedics, because that department uses 25 percent of the Human
Resources Department’s services
• 50 percent (or $35,101) to Internal Medicine, because that department uses 50 percent of the
Human Resources Department’s services.
A similar explanation underlies the Administration and Accounting row and the Patient Records row in
Exhibit 17–10 .
The total costs allocated to Riverside Clinic’s two direct-patient-care departments are as follows:
$120,018 to Orthopedics and $229,982 to Internal Medicine. Notice that these two amounts add up to
$350,000, which is the total of the original traceable costs for the three service departments. Thus, all
service department costs have been fully allocated.
The reciprocal-services method is more accurate than the direct and step-down methods, because
it fully accounts for reciprocal services. To make the reciprocal-services method even more accurate, it
can be combined with the dual-allocation approach. In this approach, variable and fixed costs are allo-
cated separately. This method is explored in Problem 17–34 .

uct he had personally developed, would not be manufactured.
Turner: “The company’s making a big mistake if it passes up this opportunity. Compodalene will
be a big seller and get us into new markets.”
Dalton: “But the analysis shows that we’d be losing money on every gallon of Compod that we
process further.”
Turner: “I know, Christine, but that’s a temporary problem. Eventually, we’ll bring down the cost
of making Compodalene.”

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
Internal Controls, and
Management Accounting
AFTER COMPLETING THIS APPENDIX, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
1 Understand and discuss the concept of internal controls over financial reporting.
2 Understand and discuss the role of the PCAOB and the implications of Sarbanes-
Oxley Sections 302 and 404.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (often abbreviated as SOX) was enacted by the U.S. Congress in
2002 in the aftermath of several corporate accounting scandals. Accounting problems at
Enron and W orldcom, and other debacles, resulted in a precipitous drop in the investing
public’s confidence in companies’ published financial statements. SOX was enacted to
bring about reform in companies’ financial reporting processes, as well as the internal and
external auditing of the financial reporting process. Under SOX, a company’s top execu-
tives, including the CEO (chief executive officer) and the CFO (chief financial officer), can
be held criminally responsible if their firm’s financial statements prove to be fraudulent or
materially misstate the firm’s financial condition.
The SOX act runs 66 pages long and consists of 11 major parts (called titles), each of
which is organized into several sections. SOX is a very complicated piece of legislation,
and most of it relates primarily to corporate governance, financial accounting, auditing,
and the penalties that the courts can invoke for violations of the law. 1 Three sections of
SOX are germane to management accounting, because they address aspects of internal
controls over financial reporting. Before covering these three sections of SOX, let’s digress
for a brief discussion of internal controls.

organization’s management and interested outside parties to have confidence in the
organization’s financial reports. These reports include the financial statements in the orga-
nization’s annual report, the 10K filed with the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion), tax returns filed with tax authorities, and other public financial disclosures. Even
a moderately large company has thousands of procedures that can properly be viewed as
internal controls. “They include a range of activities as diverse as approvals, authoriza-
tions, verifications, reconciliations, reviews of operating performance, security of assets,
and separation of duties.”3 A few examples follow.
• Physical control over raw-material, work-in-process, and finished-goods
inventories to prevent loss due to theft.
• Maintenance of adequate cost records to justify inventory valuations.
• Limitations on who is authorized to make purchases of various types and
value.
• Requirement that two individuals sign checks to reduce the possibility of
fraudulent expenditures.
This list could go on and on. Moreover, in the age of computerized accounting systems,
many internal control procedures are automated. When you make a purchase from a
major retailer, for example, the sale is entered into a computerized cash register by the
salesperson. All sales are then accumulated across time by the retailer’s accounting soft-
ware system, and the result is a sales revenue figure on the firm’s income statement.
Suppose, though, that there was a glitch in the company’s accounting software such that
this sales accumulation process was not accurate. Among the retailer’s internal controls
would be safeguards to ensure that the software is working properly and doing what it is
supposed to do.4 Other important software controls include limits on who in the organiza-
tion has the authority to access computer programs and data.
To summarize, a large company’s internal controls over financial reporting comprise
a vast array of policies and procedures involving potentially hundreds of individuals.
Since accounting information is used by both managers inside the company and inter-
ested parties outside the organization, internal controls are crucial to the integrity of both
managerial and financial accounting. Now let’s turn our attention to the three sections of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that address internal controls.

Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO, 2005), p. 1.

4 There are many anecdotes of software glitches that resulted in flawed financial information or other mistakes. In
one such incident, a company’s billing software was incorrectly designed to express amounts in cents, rather than
dollars, resulting in the company sending out bills for, say 10,000 dollars rather than the correct amount of
100 dollars (which is equivalent to 10,000 cents).

Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
Title I, Section 101 of SOX established the P ublic Company Accounting Oversight

Board (PCAOB). With five full-time board members operating under the auspices of
Understand and discuss the the SEC, the PCAOB’s mission is to “oversee and investigate the audits and auditors of
role of the PCAOB and the public companies, and sanction both firms and individuals for violations of laws, rules,
implications of Sarbanes-Oxley and regulations.”5 The PCAOB’s A uditing Standard No. 2, entitled A n Audit of Internal
Sections 302 and 404. Control over Financial Reporting Performed in Conjunction with an Audit of Financial
Statements, details the board’s requirements for auditors as they assess and attest to a
client’s internal control system.
SOX Sections 302 and 404
The SOX sections that have caused the most significant challenges for companies, and
hence created the most controversy, are sections 302 and 404.
SOX 302 Entitled Corporate Responsibility for Financial Reports, SOX section 302
requires the signing officers of a company’s financial reports to establish, maintain, and
periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s internal controls over financial
reporting. The following is an excerpt from SOX section 302, part (a).
(4) The signing officers:
(A) are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal controls;
(B) have designed such internal controls to ensure that material information relating to
the issuer [of the financial reports] and its consolidated subsidiaries is made known
to such officers by others within those entities . . . ;
(C) have evaluated the effectiveness of the issuer’s internal controls as of a date within
90 days prior to the report;
(D) have presented in the report their conclusions about the effectiveness of their
internal controls based on their evaluation as of that date.6
Section 302 goes on to require that the signing officers must disclose to the company’s
auditors any material weaknesses or changes in the company’s internal control system.
SOX 404 Entitled M anagement Assessment of Internal Controls, SOX section 404
requires a company to include in its annual report an internal control report. SOX section
404, part (a) states that the internal control report shall:
(1) state the responsibility of management for establishing and maintaining an adequate inter-
nal control structure and procedures for financial reporting; and
(2) contain an assessment, as of the end of the most recent fiscal year of the issuer, of the
effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures of the issuer for financial
reporting. 7
SOX section 404, part (b) addresses the role of the company’s auditor, as the following
excerpt shows:
(b) Internal Control Evaluation and Reporting: With respect to the internal control assessment
required by subsection (a), each registered public accounting firm that prepares or issues
the audit report for the issuer [of the financial reports] shall attest to and report on the
assessment [of the internal controls] made by the management of the issuer.8

Appendix I The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Internal Controls, and Management Accounting 769
Implications of SOX Sections 302 and 404
SOX section 302(a)(4)(C), excerpted earlier in this appendix, is “one of the most seri-
ous and onerous requirements imposed by SOX. The CEO and CFO are expected to be
able to demonstrate that there is a reliable process in place to evaluate, at least quarterly,
the internal controls in place to ensure the reliability of the data being produced.” 9 SOX
section 404 then adds the requirement that the company’s annual report include a report
assessing the company’s internal controls over financial reporting.
To summarize, SOX sections 302 and 404 go hand in hand. Section 302 essentially
requires that management establish, maintain, and periodically assess the company’s
internal controls over financial reporting. Section 404 then requires that management
include in the company’s annual report a separate report that assesses those internal con-
trols. Moreover, the company’s auditors are required to attest as to the effectiveness of the
internal controls.
In the relatively short time since its enactment, SOX sections 302 and 404 have
caused a firestorm of controversy in business and accounting. Managers of many com-
panies have complained about the onerous requirements imposed by sections 302 and
404 for detailed reporting on internal controls, as well as the extensive documentation
required to back up the internal control reports. These requirements have been particu-
larly burdensome for small businesses, which often lack the resources to comply with
sections 302 and 404. Others defend sections 302 and 404 as necessary reforms in the
wake of Enron and other corporate scandals. The SEC’s chief accountant had this to
say, “If you think [SOX section] 404 does nothing for fraud, you’re doing it wrong.” He
went on to say that “companies may indeed be implementing 404 incorrectly by failing
to focus on those controls that pose substantial risk.” Nevertheless, the chief accountant
admitted that the SEC was surprised by the cost of compliance with section 404. “Our
estimates were way off,” he said.1 0
The concept of controlling substantial risk exposure may well be the key to mak-
ing SOX sections 302 and 404 work. It is probably not reasonable to require com-
panies to report on the minutia of their internal controls over financial reporting.
If management maintains, assesses, and reports on the internal control areas where
the greatest risk of fraud or material misstatement occurs, that may be enough to
achieve the objectives of SOX. Accordingly, the PCAOB has announced its intention
to investigate whether auditors appropriately use a risk-based approach in determin-
ing where to focus their evaluations of internal controls.1 1 The PCAOB also issued a
statement that it would be examining whether accountants “focused on those controls
that pose the greatest risk to the company’s financial statements.” 12 For example, asks
the SEC’s chief accountant, “can the CFO go into the [accounting] system and make
entries?”1 3
The controversy over SOX sections 302 and 404 is not going away any time soon.
Several U.S. senators have called for the repeal of Sarbanes-Oxley altogether. Others
in Congress believe the law needs modification. Still other lawmakers have suggested
that small businesses should be exempt from SOX sections 302 and 404. A Google

search of SOX section 404 yielded many current news articles. Among the headlines
are the following:
• “Sarbanes-Oxley 404: The Section of Unintended Consequences”
• “Will the SEC Change the Sarbanes-Oxley Law?”
• “Sarbanes-Oxley Weighs on Small Companies”
• “SEC to Hear Complaints over Sarbanes-Oxley Law”
• “U.S. Supreme Court to Decide Corporate Reform Law”
• “Sarbanes-Oxley Audit Board Unconstitutional, Top Court Says”
On June 28, 2010, as reported by Bloomberg Business Week, “The U.S. Supreme
Court ruled that Congress violated the Constitution when it set up an auditing board
after the Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc. collapses, saying the panel was too insulated
from presidential control. In a 5-4 decision that reinvigorates separation of powers prin-
ciples, the court said the president must have more power to remove the members of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The board was established by the 2002
Sarbanes-Oxley law. The ruling leaves it to Congress to re-establish the panel with tighter
oversight, potentially setting up a new legislative fight that might sweep in other aspects
of Sarbanes-Oxley.”14
The high court did not strike down the key oversight authority of the PCAOB, but
rather the procedures used to appoint or remove its members. Therefore, most of the key
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act remain in force, at least for the foreseeable future.
Exactly where SOX will end up is anybody’s guess, but it is likely to remain in some
form. Moreover, the SEC is unlikely to eliminate the law’s reforms on internal controls
over financial reporting embodied in sections 302 and 404.

Appendix II
Compound Interest
and the Concept of
Present Value
AFTER COMPLETING THIS APPENDIX, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
1 Explain the importance of the time value of money in capital-budgeting decisions.
2 Compute the future value and present value of cash flows occurring over several
time periods.
Before we can study the methods used to make capital-budgeting decisions, we must
examine the basic tools used in those methods. The fundamental concept in a capital-
budgeting decision analysis is the t ime value of money. Would you rather receive a $100
gift check from a relative today, or would you rather receive a letter promising the $100
in a year? Most of us would rather have the cash now. There are two possible reasons for
this attitude. First, if we receive the money today, we can spend it on that new sweater
now instead of waiting a year. Second, as an alternative strategy, we can invest the $100
received today at 10 percent interest. Then, at the end of one year, we will have $110.
Thus, there is a time value associated with money. A $100 cash flow today is not the same
as a $100 cash flow in 1 year, 2 years, or 10 years.
Compound Interest Suppose you invest $100 today (time 0) at 10 percent
interest for one year. How much will you have after one year? The answer is $110, as the
following analysis shows.

Appendix II Compound Interest and the Concept of Present Value 773
The $110 at time 1 (end of one year) is composed of two parts, as shown below.
Principal, time 0 amount ....................................................................................................................................... $100
Interest earned during year 1 (.10 % $100) ........................................................................................................... 10
Amount at time 1 ................................................................................................................................................. $110
Thus, the $110 at time 1 consists of the $100 at time 0, called the p rincipal, plus the $10
of interest earned during the year.
Now suppose you leave your $110 invested during the second year. How much will
you have at the end of two years? As the following analysis shows, the answer is $121.

Learning Objective 2
Compute the future value and
present value of cash flows
occurring over several time
periods.
We can break down the $121 at time 2 into two parts as follows:
Amount at time 1 ................................................................................................................................................. $110
Interest earned during year 2 (.10 % $110) ........................................................................................................... 11
Amount at time 2 ................................................................................................................................................. $121
Notice that you earned more interest in year 2 ($11) than you earned in year 1 ($10).
Why? During year 2, you earned 10 percent interest on the original principal of $100 and
you earned 10 percent interest on the year 1 interest of $10. Interest earned on prior peri-
ods’ interest is called c ompound interest. Exhibit II–1 shows how your invested funds
grow over the five-year period of the investment. As the exhibit shows, the f uture value
of your initial $100 investment is $161.05 after five years.
As the number of years in an investment increases, it becomes more cumber-
some to compute the future value of the investment using the method in Exhibit II–1 .

774 Appendix II Compound Interest and the Concept of Present Value
Fortunately, the simple formula shown below may be used to compute the future value of
any investment.
F ! P(1 " r )n (1)
n
where P denotes principal
r denotes interest rate per year
n denotes number of years
Using formula (1) to compute the future value after five years of your $100 investment,
we have the following computation.
F ! P(1 " r )n
n
! $100(1 " .10 ) 5
! $100(1.6105) ! $161.05
The value of (1 " r ) n is called the a ccumulation factor. The values of (1 " r ) n , for vari-
ous combinations of r and n , are tabulated in Table I of Appendix A to Chapter 16, which
appears on page 720.
Use formula (1) and the tabulated values in Table I to compute the future value after
10 years of an $800 investment that earns interest at the rate of 12 percent per year.1
Present Value In the discussion above, we computed the future value of an invest-
ment when the original principal is known. Now consider a slightly different problem.
Suppose you know how much money you want to accumulate at the end of a five-year
investment. Your problem is to determine how much your initial investment needs to be
in order to accumulate the desired amount in five years. To solve this problem, we start
with formula (1):
F ! P(1 " r )n
n
Now divide each side of the preceding equation by (1 " r ) n
 1 
P F
n   (1 r)n  (2)
In formula (2), P denotes what is commonly referred to as the present value of the cash
flow F , which occurs after n years when the interest rate is r .
n
Let’s try out formula (2) on your investment problem, which we analyzed in
Exhibit II–1 . Suppose you did not know the value of the initial investment required if you
want to accumulate $161.05 at the end of five years in an investment that earns 10 percent
per year. We can determine the present value of the investment as follows:
 1 
P F
n   (1 r)n 
 1 
$161.05
 
(1 .10)5
$1661.05(.6209) $100
1 Using formula (1): F ! $800(1 " .12)1 0 . From Table I, (1 " .12)1 0 ! 3.106. (Note that the values in Table I are
rounded.) Thus, the future value of the investment is ($800)(3.106) ! $2,484.80. Compound interest will more than
triple the original $800 investment in 10 years.

Appendix II Compound Interest and the Concept of Present Value 775
Thus, as we knew already, you must invest $100 now in order to accumulate $161.05
after five years in an investment earning 10 percent per year. The present value of $100
and the f uture value of $161.05 at time 5 are e conomically equivalent, given that the
annual interest rate is 10 percent. If you are planning to invest the $100 received now,
then you should be indifferent between receiving the present value of $100 now or receiv-
ing the future value of $161.05 at the end of five years.
When we used formula (2) to compute the present value of the $161.05 cash flow
at time 5, we used a process called discounting. The interest rate used when we dis-
count a future cash flow to compute its present value is called the discount rate. The
value of 1/(1 " r ) n , which appears in formula (2), is called the discount factor. Discount
factors, for various combinations of r and n, are tabulated in Table III of Appendix A
to Chapter 16.
Suppose you want to accumulate $18,000 to buy a car in four years, and you can
earn interest at the rate of 8 percent per year on an investment you make now. How
much do you need to invest now? Use formula (2) and the discount factors in Table III of
Appendix A to Chapter 16 (p. 721) to compute the present value of the required $18,000
amount needed at the end of four years.2
Present Value of a Cash-Flow Series The present-value problem we just
solved involved only a single future cash flow. Now consider a slightly different problem.
Suppose you just won $5,000 in the state lottery. You want to spend some of the cash
now, but you have decided to save enough to rent a beach condominium during spring
break of each of the next three years. You would like to deposit enough in a bank account
now so that you can withdraw $1,000 from the account at the end of each of the next three
years. The money in the bank account will earn 8 percent per year. The question, then, is
how much do you need to deposit? Another way of asking the same question is, what is
the p resent value of a series of three $1,000 cash flows at the end of each of the next three
years, given that the discount rate is 8 percent?
Present
Value
?
$1,000 $1,000 $1,000
Time
0 1 2 3
One way to figure out the answer to the question is to compute the present value
of each of the three $1,000 cash flows and add the three present-value amounts. We
can use formula (2) for these calculations, as shown in panel A of Exhibit II–2 . Notice
that the present value of each of the $1,000 cash flows is different, because the tim-
ing of the cash flows is different. The earlier the cash flow will occur, the higher is its
present value.
Examine panel A of Exhibit II–2 carefully. We obtained the $2,577 total present
value by adding three present-value amounts. Each of these amounts is the result of mul-
tiplying $1,000 by a discount factor. Notice that we can obtain the same final result by
adding the three discount factors first, and then multiplying by $1,000. This approach
is taken in panel B of Exhibit II–2 . The sum of the three discount factors is called an
annuity discount factor, because a series of equivalent cash flows is called an a nnuity.
Annuity discount factors for various combinations of r and n are tabulated in Table IV of
Appendix A to Chapter 16 (p. 722).
2 Using formula (2): P ! $18,000 % [1/(1 " .08)4 ]. From Table III, 1/(1 " .08)4 ! .735. (Note that the values in
Table III are rounded.) Thus, the present value of the required $18,000 amount is ($18,000)(.735) ! $13,230. An
investment of $13,230 made now, earning annual interest at 8 percent, will accumulate to $18,000 at the end of four
years.

from the condo owner’s perspective. Suppose the owner invests each $1,000 rental pay-
ment in a bank account that pays 8 percent interest per year. How much will the condo
owner accumulate at the end of the three-year period? An equivalent question is, What is
the future value of the three-year series of $1,000 cash flows, given an annual interest rate
of 8 percent? Exhibit II–4 answers the question in two ways. In panel A of the exhibit,
three separate future-value calculations are made using formula (1). Notice that the
$1,000 cash flow at time 1 is multiplied by (1.08)2 , since it has two years to earn interest.
The $1,000 cash flow at time 2 has only one year to earn interest, and the time 3 cash flow
has no time to earn interest.
In panel B of the exhibit, the three-year a nnuity accumulation facto r is used. This
factor is the sum of the three accumulation factors used in panel A of the exhibit. The
annuity accumulation factors for various combinations of r and n are tabulated in Table II
of Appendix A to Chapter 16 (p. 721).
Using the Tables Correctly When using the tables in Appendix A to Chapter 16
(pp. 720–722) to solve future-value and present-value problems, be sure to select the cor-
rect table. Table I is used to find the future value of a s ingle cash flow, and Table III is
used to find the present value of a single cash flow. Table II is used in finding the future
value of a s eries of identical cash flows; Table IV is used in finding the p resent value of
a series of identical cash flows. Be careful not to confuse future value with present value
or to confuse a single cash flow with a series of identical cash flows.
If you have a calculator that will exponentiate (raise a number to a power), you can
forget the tables altogether. Just use the pertinent formula and compute the appropriate
factor yourself.

Inventory Management
AFTER COMPLETING THIS APPENDIX, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
1 Calculate the economic order quantity (EOQ) using the EOQ decision model.
2 Understand the differences between the economic-order-quantity and just-in-time
approaches to inventory management.

Calculate the economic order tant input to the budgeting system. Inventory decisions involve a delicate balance between
quantity (EOQ) using the EOQ three classes of costs: ordering costs, holding costs, and shortage costs. Examples of
decision model. costs in each of these categories are given in Exhibit III–1 .
The following illustration emphasizes the benefits of a sound inventory policy.
Economic Order Quantity
Cozycamp.com , a camping equipment manufacturer, has recently expanded its product
line into winter sports equipment. The company’s newest product is a fiberglass snow-
board. One of the raw materials is a special resin used to bind the fiberglass in the mold-
ing phase of production. The production manager, Hi Mogul, uses an economic order
quantity (EOQ) decision model to determine the size and frequency with which resin is
cozycamp.com
ordered. The EOQ model is a mathematical tool for determining the order quantity that
minimizes the costs of ordering and holding inventory.
Resin is purchased in 50-gallon drums, and 9,600 drums are used each year. Each
drum costs $400. The controller estimates that the cost of placing and receiving a typical
resin order is $225. The controller’s estimate of the annual cost of carrying resin in inven-
tory is $3 per drum.
Tabular Approach Suppose Mogul orders 800 drums of resin in each order placed
during the year. The total annual cost of ordering and holding resin in inventory is calcu-
lated as follows:

of inventory policy
Notice that the $3,900 cost does not include the purchase cost of the resin at $400 per
drum. We are focusing only on the costs of o rdering and h olding resin inventory.
Can Mogul do any better than $3,900 for the annual cost of his resin inventory pol-
icy? Exhibit III–2 , which tabulates the inventory costs for various order quantities, indi-
cates that Mogul can lower the costs of ordering and holding resin inventory. Of the five
order quantities listed, the 1,200-drum order quantity yields the lowest total annual cost.
Unfortunately, this tabular method for finding the least-cost order quantity is cumber-
some. Moreover, it does not necessarily result in the optimal order quantity. It is possible
that some order quantity other than those listed in Exhibit III–2 is the least-cost order
quantity.
Equation Approach The total annual cost of ordering and holding inventory is
given by the following equation.

The following formula for the least-cost order quantity, called the economic order
quantity (or EOQ), has been developed using calculus.

The EOQ formula in Cozycamp.com’s problem yields the following EOQ for resin.
_____________
(2)(9,600)(225)
EOQ ! √ _______ _ _____ ! 1,200
3
Graphical Approach Another method for solving the EOQ problem is the graphi-
cal method, which is presented in Exhibit III–3 . Notice that the ordering-cost line slants
down to the right. This indicates a decline in these costs as the order size increases and
the order frequency decreases. However, as the order size increases, so does the average
inventory on hand. This results in an increase in holding costs, as indicated by the posi-
tive slope of the holding-cost line. The EOQ falls at 1,200 units, where the best balance is
struck between these two costs. Total costs are minimized at $3,600.
Timing of Orders
The EOQ model helps management decide how much to order at a time. Another important
decision is when to order. This decision depends on the l ead time, which is the length of
time it takes for the material to be received after an order is placed. Suppose the lead time
for resin is one month. Since Cozycamp.com uses 9,600 drums of resin per year, and the
production rate is constant throughout the year, this implies that 800 drums are used each
month. Production manager Mogul should order resin, in the economic order quantity of
1,200 drums, when the inventory falls to 800 drums. By the time the new order arrives, one
month later, the 800 drums in inventory will have been used in production. Exhibit III–4
depicts this pattern of ordering and using inventory. By placing an order early enough to
avoid a stockout, management takes into account the potential costs of shortages.
Safety Stock Our example assumed that the usage of resin is constant at 800 drums
per month. Suppose instead that monthly usage fluctuates between 600 and 1,000 drums.
Although average monthly usage still is 800 drums, there is the potential for an excess
usage of 200 drums in any particular month. In light of this uncertainty, management may
wish to keep a safety stock of resin equal to the potential excess monthly usage of 200
drums. With a safety stock of 200 drums, the reorder point is 1,000 drums. Thus, Mogul
should order the EOQ of 1,200 drums whenever resin inventory falls to 1,000 drums.
During the one-month lead time, another 600 to 1,000 drums of resin will be consumed
in production. Although a safety stock will increase inventory holding costs, it will mini-
mize the potential costs caused by shortages.

the number of vendors, negotiating long-term supply agreements, making less frequent approaches to inventory
payments, and eliminating inspections. The implication of the JIT philosophy is that management.
inventories should be minimized by more frequent deliveries in smaller quantities. This
result can be demonstrated using the EOQ formula, as shown in Exhibit III–5 . As the

cost of holding inventory increases, the EOQ decreases. Moreover, as the cost of plac-
ing an order declines, the EOQ decreases.
The economics underlying the EOQ model support the JIT viewpoint that inventory
should be purchased or produced in small quantities, and inventories should be kept to
the absolute minimum. However, the basic philosophies of JIT and EOQ are quite dif-
ferent. The EOQ approach takes the view that some inventory is necessary, and the goal
is to optimize the order quantity in order to balance the cost of ordering against the cost
of holding inventory. In contrast, the JIT philosophy argues that holding costs tend to be
higher than may be apparent because of the inefficiency and waste of storing inventory.
Thus, inventory should be minimized, or even eliminated completely if possible. More-
over, under the JIT approach, orders typically will vary in size, depending on needs. The
EOQ model, in contrast, results in a constant order quantity.
