*Q4 ending inventory assumes next year Q1 production = 900 units

### Test Case 2: JIT Material (Tent Poles)

**Material 2: Tent Poles (Add Another Material)**

| Field | Value | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Material Name | Tent Poles | |
| Unit of Measure | kits | |
| Required per Unit Produced | 1.0 | Each tent needs 1 kit of poles |
| Cost per Unit | $8.00 | Base cost per kit |
| Beginning Inventory | 0 | JIT delivery |
| Ending Inventory Ratio | 0.10 | Ignored due to JIT |
| **Use JIT** | ✓ checked | **No ending inventory** |

**Expected Results:**

| Metric | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Yearly |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------|
| Production Needs | 900 | 1,350 | 1,080 | 1,170 | 4,500 |
| Material Required | 900 | 1,350 | 1,080 | 1,170 | 4,500 |
| Desired Ending Inventory | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Total Required | 900 | 1,350 | 1,080 | 1,170 | 4,500 |
| Beginning Inventory | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Material to Purchase | 900 | 1,350 | 1,080 | 1,170 | 4,500 |
| Cost per Unit | $8.00 | $8.00 | $8.00 | $8.00 | $8.00 |
| **Total Purchase Cost** | **$7,200** | **$10,800** | **$8,640** | **$9,360** | **$36,000** |

**Total Material Purchase Cost (Both Materials):**
- Q1: $24,900
- Q2: $37,260
- Q3: $30,420
- Q4: $32,220
- **Yearly Total: $124,800**

### Test Case 3: Advanced Features - Scrap/Waste Allowance

**Modify Tent Fabric (Material 1):**
- Scrap/Waste %: **0.05** (5% waste)
- Keep all other values the same

**Expected Impact:**
- Material required increases by 5% to account for waste
- Q1 Material Required: 3,600 × 1.05 = **3,780 yards** (instead of 3,600)
- Purchase quantities and costs increase proportionally
- System should show "Scrap Waste Cost" in analytics

**Calculation Formula:**
```
Waste Multiplier = 1 + scrapWastePercentage
Material Required = Production Needs × Required per Unit × Waste Multiplier
```

### Test Case 4: Bulk Discount Pricing

**Modify Tent Fabric (Material 1):**
- Bulk Discount Threshold: **5000** yards
- Bulk Discount Rate: **0.10** (10% discount)
- Remove scrap/waste for this test (set to blank)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Q1: Purchase 3,540 yards (< 5000) → Pay $5.00/yard = $17,700
- Q2: Purchase 5,292 yards (> 5000) → Pay $4.50/yard = $23,814 (saved $2,646)
- Q3: Purchase 4,356 yards (< 5000) → Pay $5.00/yard = $21,780
- Q4: Purchase 4,572 yards (< 5000) → Pay $5.00/yard = $22,860

**Analytics should show:**
- Total Bulk Discount Savings: $2,646 (Q2 only)

### Test Case 5: Quarterly Price Inflation

**Modify Tent Fabric (Material 1):**
- Price Inflation Rate: **0.02** (2% per quarter)
- Remove bulk discount settings

**Expected Cost Per Unit:**
- Q1: $5.00 (base)
- Q2: $5.10 (5.00 × 1.02)
- Q3: $5.20 (5.10 × 1.02)
- Q4: $5.31 (5.20 × 1.02)

**Expected Purchase Costs:**
- Q1: 3,540 × $5.00 = $17,700
- Q2: 5,292 × $5.10 = $26,989
- Q3: 4,356 × $5.20 = $22,651
- Q4: 4,572 × $5.31 = $24,277
- **Total increases from $88,800 to $91,617**

### Test Case 6: Cash Disbursement Calculations

**Payment Terms Section:**
- Next Year Q1 Production: **900** (for Q4 ending inventory)
- % Paid in Current Quarter: **0.60** (60%)
- % Paid in Next Quarter: **0.40** (40%)

**Expected Cash Disbursements:**
Using Tent Fabric with base cost ($88,800 total):
- Q1: $0 (prior period balance) + $17,700 × 0.60 = $10,620
- Q2: $17,700 × 0.40 + $26,460 × 0.60 = $22,956
- Q3: $26,460 × 0.40 + $21,780 × 0.60 = $23,652
- Q4: $21,780 × 0.40 + $22,860 × 0.60 = $22,428

### Test Case 7: Inventory Turnover Metrics

**Expected Analytics (Tent Fabric, basic scenario):**

```
Inventory Turnover Ratio = Material Used / Average Inventory
Material Used = 18,000 yards (yearly)
Average Inventory = (600 + 540 + 432 + 468 + 360) / 5 = 480 yards
Turnover Ratio = 18,000 / 480 = 37.5x annually
Days Inventory Outstanding = 365 / 37.5 = 9.7 days
```

**For JIT Materials (Tent Poles):**
- Average Inventory = 0
- Turnover Ratio = Infinity (or marked as N/A)
- This is expected and correct for JIT

### Test Case 8: Critical Materials Identification

**Materials flagged as critical when:**
- Inventory Turnover < 4x annually, OR
- Days Inventory Outstanding > 90 days

**Test Setup:**
Create a slow-moving material:
- Material Name: "Specialty Thread"
- Required per Unit: 0.1
- Beginning Inventory: 1000
- Production Needs: Very low (results in < 4x turnover)

**Expected:**
- Analytics section should show: "⚠ Critical Materials (low turnover): Specialty Thread"

### Test Case 9: Combined Enhancements

**Realistic Manufacturing Scenario:**

**Material: High-Quality Canvas**
- Required per Unit: 5.0 yards
- Cost per Unit: $12.00
- Beginning Inventory: 800 yards
- Ending Inventory Ratio: 0.15 (15% - higher safety stock)
- Scrap/Waste %: 0.08 (8% waste - cutting losses)
- Price Inflation Rate: 0.03 (3% quarterly - supply chain pressures)
- Bulk Discount Threshold: 6000 yards
- Bulk Discount Rate: 0.12 (12% volume discount)
- Supplier Lead Time: 45 days
- Use JIT: unchecked

**Expected Results:**
Complex interaction of:
1. Waste increases material requirements
2. Inflation raises prices each quarter
3. Bulk discount applies when threshold met
4. High safety stock (15%) for critical material

### Validation Tests

#### Error Handling Tests

**Test Invalid Inputs:**

1. **Negative values:**
   - Cost per Unit: -5 → Error: "Cost per unit cannot be negative"
   - Beginning Inventory: -100 → Error: "Beginning inventory cannot be negative"

2. **Missing required fields:**
   - Material Name: (blank) → Error: "Material name is required"
   - Required per Unit: 0 → Error: "Material required per unit must be greater than zero"

3. **Invalid percentages:**
   - Scrap/Waste %: 1.5 → Warning: "Scrap/waste percentage over 100% is unusually high"
   - Ending Inventory Ratio: -0.1 → Error: "Ending inventory ratio cannot be negative"

4. **Bulk discount validation:**
   - Discount Threshold without Discount Rate → Warning: "Bulk discount threshold set but no rate specified"
   - Discount Rate: 1.5 → Error: "Discount rate cannot exceed 100%"

5. **Payment terms validation:**
   - % Paid Current + % Paid Next ≠ 1.0 → Warning: "Payment percentages should sum to 100%"

#### Dependency Tests

1. **Calculate without Schedule 2:**
   - Click "Calculate Material Budget" without production data
   - Expected: Alert "Please calculate Production Budget first (Schedule 2)"

2. **Multiple materials:**
   - Add 3+ materials
   - Remove middle material
   - Verify calculations still correct for remaining materials

## CSV Export Testing

**Test Export Functionality:**

1. Click "Download CSV" button
2. Verify file downloads: `direct-material-budget-[company-name].csv`
3. Open in Excel/Google Sheets
4. Verify structure:
   - Company header
   - Separate section for each material
   - Total summary section
   - Proper formatting (no corrupt data)

**Expected CSV Structure:**

### 📊 Calculation Formulas Implemented

**Material Required:**
```
Material Required = Units to Produce × Material per Unit × (1 + Waste %)
```

**Desired Ending Inventory:**
```
Ending Inventory = Next Quarter's Production Needs × Material per Unit × Ending Ratio
(Unless JIT = true, then Ending Inventory = 0)
```

**Material to Purchase:**
```
Material to Purchase = (Material Required + Desired Ending Inventory) - Beginning Inventory
```

**Cost Per Unit (with inflation and discounts):**
```
Base Cost in Quarter N = Base Cost × (1 + Inflation Rate)^(N-1)
If Purchase Quantity ≥ Bulk Threshold:
    Final Cost = Base Cost × (1 - Discount Rate)
Else:
    Final Cost = Base Cost
```

**Total Purchase Cost:**
```
Total Cost = Material to Purchase × Cost Per Unit
```

**Inventory Turnover:**
```
Annual Turnover = Total Material Used / Average Inventory
Days Outstanding = 365 / Annual Turnover
```

**Critical Material Identification:**
```
IF Turnover < 4x OR Days Outstanding > 90:
    Flag as Critical Material
```
