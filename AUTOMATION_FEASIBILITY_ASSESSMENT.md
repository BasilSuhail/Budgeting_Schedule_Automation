## APPENDIX A: TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION SAMPLE

```python
# Sample code structure for automating Sales Budget

class SalesBudgetCalculator:
    def __init__(self, historical_sales, growth_rate, inflation_rate):
        self.historical_sales = historical_sales  # Dict: {Q1: value, Q2: value...}
        self.growth_rate = growth_rate
        self.inflation_rate = inflation_rate

    def calculate_forecasted_sales(self):
        forecasted_sales = {}
        for quarter, sales in self.historical_sales.items():
            # Apply growth rate and inflation
            adjusted_sales = sales * (1 + self.growth_rate) * (1 + self.inflation_rate)
            forecasted_sales[quarter] = adjusted_sales
        return forecasted_sales

    def generate_sales_budget(self):
        forecast = self.calculate_forecasted_sales()
        budget = {
            'quarters': forecast,
            'yearly_total': sum(forecast.values()),
            'average_quarterly': sum(forecast.values()) / len(forecast)
        }
        return budget
```

This is just 1 of 13 schedules - but it shows the automation is straightforward.
